Since authority is a matter of both\\ncommunicator and recepiant we can say that, for example \"Jesus\\nis Lord\" whether the world at large accepts the authority or\\nnot. Thus the Bible can be considered for its authoritative\\ncontent whether or not it is accepted (This issue is at the\\nheart of Pilate\\'s pragmatic question \"What is truth?\" to Jesus\\nwhen our Lord was brought before Him. Jesus\\' reply was to appeal\\nto the authority of his Father)\\nYou also might like to consider the claimed authority\\nrepresented by the statements \"thus says the Lord\" in the Bible,\\nwhich claim to put across the exact words of God.\\n\\nYou fall into the danger of relativism with your rejection of\\ninherant authority and claim that it lies only in the \"community\\nof faith\" - does something become truth because it is accepted?\\nThe main thrust of my argument is that there is a Godward\\ndirection as well as a manward (which is where the reference to\\nRev 22 came in.)\\n\\n\\nIf we narrowed it down to the predictive elements - which will\\ncut out some of the 39 accepted OT books as well - we\\nnonetheless have criteria for determining the validity of the\\nbook: Jesus\\' standards were that \"Scripture cannot be broken\".\\nCan you name a single prophecy that fits the bill in the Apocrapha?\\n(ie definitely fulfilled AFTER it has been written)\\n\\n\\nDoes it have a subjective \\'ring of truth\\' about it - and does\\nother evidence that has come to light contradict or confirm the\\nauthenticity? (archaeological, other textual evidence for\\nexample)\\n\\n\\nWhat this is getting at is the relationship between text and\\nreader. It is to do with the quality of writing, which should\\nhave the ability to fire the mind, affect our thought life and\\ncause us to act in a certain way - there is something of this\\nin Jesus\\' quote: \"Man does not live by bread alone, but by every\\nword that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord\". (Matt 4.4)\\n\\n\\nDoes the Catholic Church give the same authority to the\\nApocrapha as to the accepted 66 books? Certainly it is not as\\nwidely used as the OT and NT.\\n\\n\\nThink about what I have said above. You may want to revise your\\nconclusion. In addition think about other \\'sacred writings\\', eg\\nthe Koran, the book of Mormon and how and why you would\\ncategorise them using the above principles. One word of caution\\n- you may find some \\'reflected glory\\' in some of these books: in\\nthat the \\'inspired quality\\' may be derived from the Bible.\\nRemember that Lucifer is quite capable of appearing as an angel\\nof light and quoting Scripture.\\n\\n\\nWhat were you thinking of?\\n\\n\\nWe\\'ve lost the point and the context here. I am not arguing that\\nthe statement in Rev. can be applied indescriminately, just that\\nthe whole acceptance/rejection idea does not just follow on from\\nman-made traditions - but there is I believe an act of God\\ninvolved in the selection and criteria of what is classified as\\nScripture and comes under the definition of 2Tim 3.16.\\n',\n",
       " 'Another article that fell between the cracks:\\n\\n As evidence for the Resurrection, it is often claimed that the Disciples\\nwere tortured to death for their beliefs and still did not renounce\\ntheir claim that Jesus had come back from the dead.\\n Now, I skimmed Acts and such, and I found a reference to this happening\\nto Stephen, but no others. Where does this apparently very widely held\\nbelief come from? Is there any evidence outside the Bible? Is there any\\nevidence *in* the Bible? I sure haven\\'t found any...\\n\\nBriefly, no.  There is widespread folklore, but no good documentary\\nevidence, or even solid rumor, concerning the deaths of the Apostles.\\nFurther, the usual context of such arguments, as you observe, is \"No\\nMartyrs for a Lie\": i.e. the willingness of these people to die rather\\nthan recant is evidence for the truth of their belief.  This adds the\\nquite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered\\nthe chance of life by recanting.  Since we don\\'t even know how or\\nwhere they died, we certainly don\\'t have this information.  (By the\\nway, even in the case of Stephen it is not at all clear that he could\\nhave saved himself by recanting).  The willingness of true believers\\nto die for their belief, be it in Jesus or Jim Jones, is\\nwell-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little.

We have compiled a list of suggestions to guide \\nyou. If you are interested in pursuing one or more of \\nthese suggested activities, the Educational Network can \\naid you by /coordinating/ the initial contacts, /following \\nup/, and /providing any other support/ you may need.\\n\\n1.  Link your teachers' union with a teachers' union here \\n--- linkage should be based on a shared pedagogical \\nenterprise.\\n\\n2. Get your union to actively support the right of \\nPalestinian teachers in the Occupied Territories to form \\nunions:\\n\\na. through the International Labor Organization (if your \\nunion is a member)\\nb. contacting other international unions which have \\nsupported our right to form a union -- we can supply \\nnames and addresses.\\n\\n3. Establish a SCHOLARSHIP FUND for one or more \\nPalestinian students to study at a Palestinian university \\nor school -- or establish a scholarship fund for a \\nPalestinian student or teacher to study at a university \\nabroad.\\n\\n4. Reproduce and publish information about Palestinian \\neducation:\\n\\n    a. for your union membership;\\n    b. for the outside community.\\n\\nThe Educational Network can supply up-to-date \\ninformation and statistics.\\n\\n5. Send delegations of teachers to visit the Occupied \\nTerritories during periods when our schools are in \\nsession.\\n\\nThe Network can arrange an itinerary, make hotel and \\nlocal travel arrangements, and provide a guide for the \\nvisit.\\n\\n6. Sponsor Palestinian teachers to visit your city for an \\neducational tour:\\n\\n      a. to see schools and speak with educators in order to\\n          learn about progressive pedagogical ideas and\\n           experiences;\\n\\n      b. to speak about the conditions of Palestinian\\n          education.\\n\\nThe Network will coordinate from Palestine.\\n\\n7. Establish teacher-exchange programs for one year in \\nwhich a Palestinian teacher from a private school teaches \\nat a public or private school abroad while a teacher from \\nthat school spends a year in a Palestinian private school.\\n\\n8. Send an experienced educator to the Occupied \\nTerritories to give workshops (all-day workshops or two-\\nday workshops) on innovative teaching techniques.\\n\\nThe Network will pay for the person's food, lodging, and \\ntravel while in Palestine, and will serve as guide.\\n\\n9. Set up a pen-pal program with a Palestinian school in \\neither English or French.\\n\\n10. Set up a sister-school program with a Palestinian \\nschool which would actively involve teachers as well as \\nstudents at both schools -- a great tool for building \\ninternational understanding and mutual sensitivity.\\n\\n11. Keep the Educational Network informed about \\nimportant educational conferences so that we can send a \\nPalestinian teacher to attend.\\n\\n12. Send to the Educational Network articles or other \\nwritings or books dealing with innovative approaches and \\nideas in the field of education so that we can then \\ndisseminate the information locally.\",\n",

I\\'ll leave it unnamed\\nsince I don\\'t want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not \\nsomething is a sin. Now lets apply our \"hate the sin...\" philosophy and see\\nwhat happens.

Eventually this hate becomes so \\nstrong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate\\nthe sinner. In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and \\ndo things which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even \\nbelieve what they are doing is a sin). After enough of this, the sinner begins\\nto hate us (they certainly don\\'t love us for our constant criticism of their\\nbehavior). Hate builds up and drives people away from God...this certainly\\ncannot be a good way to build love.\\n\\nIn the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our \\nneighbors. He doesn\\'t say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he \\ncommands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. So, how are Christians\\nsupposed to deal with the sin of others? I suppose that there is only one\\nway to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. We\\nneed to ask God to help us with our own sin, and to help those we love \\nwith theirs.

It can be easily inferred \\nfrom the facts on the ground and from the information \\nprovided by the Hebrew press. There is one condition, \\nthough. The torrents of claptrap about \"the peace \\nprocess\" must be totally ignored, as must Israel\\'s official \\npronouncements, whole sole purpose is to distort reality. \\nBy concentrating only on the facts, it was early apparent \\nthat Labour\\'s policies were no different from those of \\nShamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their \\nmore effective implementation.\\n\\nLikud\\'s policies were accurately described by Ariel \\nSharon in an article, accompanied by a map, in Yediot \\nAharonot last August. The Sharon plan envisaged a \\ndivision of the West Bank into seven, and the Gaza Strip \\ninto four, \"autonomous\" Palestinian enclaves, all of them \\nunder Israeli supervision. The total area of these \\nenclaves amounted to about 15 per cent of the \\nterritories. The rest was to be controlled by the Israeli \\nsettlements and the highways built around the enclaves. \\nThe entire area around Jerusalem, from the outskirts of \\nRamallah to the boundaries of Bethlehem, has already \\nbeen turned into a \"Greater Jerusalem\" where the Arab-\\ninhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded \\nby areas occupied by Israeli settlements or reserved for \\nthem.\\n\\nJudging from Labour\\'s settlement policy, it may be \\nassumed that it may content itself with a lesser number \\nof Arab enclaves of a rather larger size than Sharon had \\nplanned. But the principle of surrounding the enclaves by \\nsettlements strategically dispersed along the highways \\nremains unchanged. Labour plans only four enclaves in \\nthe West Bank: two in \"Samaria\" and two in \"Judea\" (i.e. \\nnorth and south of Jerusalem respectively), and no more \\nthan two in the Gaza Strip. In regard to \"Greater \\nJerusalem\", Labour\\'s policies hardly deviate from \\nSharon\\'s.\\n\\nA saner version of Likud policy\\n\\nAs some Israeli correspondents at once realised, Labour \\npolicies were but a saner version of Sharon\\'s \\nextravaganza. Last July, Gideon Eshet wrote in Yediot \\nAharonot that, while \"barely a few months ago\" Labour \\nsupported the demand to freeze all construction beyond \\nthe Green Line, \"no specific decision to freeze \\nconstruction in the territories has been taken\". And Uzi \\nBenziman wrote in Ha\\'aretz that \"as far as can be judged \\non the basis of the internal political discussions in \\nJerusalem, Rabin intends to stick to Likud\\'s ways\".\\n\\nThe two biggest enclaves envisaged by Labour are \\nlocated in \"Samaria\". Therefore the belt of settlements \\naround the \"Trans-Samaria Highway\", designed to \\nseparate those enclaves from each other, is of paramount \\nimportance. According to the latest data, the percentage \\nof Israeli settlers in the entire West Bank population \\n(apart from East Jerusalem) is a mere 5.5 per cent. But \\nfor the area around the \"Trans-Samaria Highway\", the \\ncorresponding figure is almost 20 per cent, and it is \\nincreasing steadily. The situation in the settlements of \\nthe \"Efrat Block\" south of Jerusalem, designed to sever \\nthe enclave around Bethlehem from the one around \\nHebron, is pretty much the same. The \"Efrat Block\" is now \\nbeing connected with West Jerusalem by a highway.\\n\\nThe project is costly in the extreme, because the highway \\nis designed to bypass Bethlehem by a sequence of long \\ntunnels. The final decision to build this highway was \\nsuspended until Rabin\\'s return from his US visit in \\nMarch. The subsequent decision to renew its construction \\ncan be seen as US approval for the enclaves plan as a \\nwhole.\\n\\nProcess of impoverishment\\n\\nThe enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady \\nimpoverishment of the Palestinians. This is well known \\nin Israel but ignored abroad by all who should be \\nconcerned, including the PLO. In regard to the Gaza Strip, \\nthe whole process was best described by Ze\\'ev Shiff in \\nHa\\'aretz in March. He mentions having seen \"a pamphlet \\nissued six years ago by the Civil Administration \\nforecasting the conditions in the Gaza Strip under Israeli \\nrule in 2000\". His analysis deserves to be quoted \\nextensively:\\n\\n\"We continue to steal the Strip\\'s water, even though its \\nquality deteriorates from year to year. We continue to \\nsteal the Strip\\'s tiny land resources, in order to found \\nthere more and more settlements, as if we deliberately \\nwant to make the inhabitants despair, and in their \\ndespair think in termws of having nothing to lose. It is \\nby our own doing that the Strip\\'s workers must now \\nspend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time \\nas they spend working. From the military point of view, \\nwe have kept control of no more than half the Strip\\'s \\narea at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and \\nresources. About a year before Moshe Arens left the \\ndefence ministry, I heard him saying that we should \\nwithdraw from the Strip come what may. His argument \\nwas that Israel sinks into the Strip ever deeper and \\ndeeper. He told me he had proposed this to Yitzhak \\nShamir but he rejected it.\" Yitzhak Rabin rejects it too.\\n\\nEnormous state support for the Qatif Block settlers can \\nalso be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being \\nimplemented. The Qatif Block settlements, founded by \\nthe first Rabin government of 1974-77, are intended to \\ndivide the Gaza Strip into two separate enclaves. Efraim \\nDavidi of Davar had data showing how vital for Israeli \\nthis enterprise is. \"The Qatif Block is now producing 40 \\nper cent of Israeli tomatoes destined for export, and a \\nsubstantial proportion of cut flowers.\" He also deals with \\nthe subsidies the settlers receive, considerably \\naugmented by the present government. Owing to them, \\nhousing units are cheap. The present government does \\nnot spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block. \\n\"Any prospective settler will get a 95 per cent mortgage \\nfor his house on top of a grant of 18,000 shekels \\n($6,500).\"\\n\\nSuch data shows that Israel\\'s plans apply whether the \\nPalestinians of the Gaza Strip are allowed or forbidden to \\nwork in Israel. The economic motivations were explained \\nby Danny Rubinstein in Ha\\'aretz in March:\\n\\n\"From the economic viewpoint Gaza could already be \\nsealed off hermetically and all the Strip\\'s workers could \\nbe barred from entering Israel...Even though accurate \\ndata is hard to come by, it is indisputable that during the \\nlast two years the numbes of Gazan workers arriving \\ndaily to work in Israel has markedly decreased, from \\n80,000 in the mid\\'80s to 40,000 today. But the decrease \\nis not only due to restrictions imposed on entering Israel \\nfrom Gaza. It is also due to the drastic curtailment of \\ndemand for Gazan labour in Israel. With unemployment \\nin Israel soaring and the construction of apartments \\nblocks virtually halted, the workers from Gaza are no \\nlonger really needed...\"\\n\\nGaza\\'s total dependence\\n\\nThe entire economy of the Gaza Strip is totally dependent \\non Israel. In recent years in the Gaza Strip there has \\nbeen an increase in sub-contracted work for Israeli \\nfactories, mostly footware and textiles. Thousands of \\nsmall workshops, employing an average of four workers, \\nget their raw materials or unfinished products, together \\nwith detailed working instructions, from Israeli factories. \\nRubinstein attributes this development to the fact that \\n\"the average wage in the Gaza Strip is merely 40 per cent \\nof that in the West Bank, which in turn stands at half the \\naverage wage in Israel; and besides the Gazan employer \\ndoes not pay any social security for his employees.\" If \\nthe average wage in the Gaza Strip is just a fifth of that \\nin Israel, the profits of Israeli factories and even of \\nPalestinian sub-contractors must be vast.\\n\\nThey are higher still when \"a Gazan sub-contractor \\nprovides labour to be performed at home, with the \\nfamily\\'s help. The livelihood of tens of thousands of \\nGazans depends on such sub-contracted work.\" Many of \\nthem are women and children, paid about ten shekels \\n($3.50) a day which can last 12 hours or more. There can \\nbe no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap Gazan \\nlabour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition \\nof Rabin and other Israeli ministers to withdrawal from \\nthe Strip.\\n\\nEconomic conditions in the Gaza Strip differ little from \\nwhat was created straight after Israel\\'s conquest [in \\n1967]. In this respect, one should not be deluded by the \\ntalk, nowadays fashionable, about Israeli gestures \\nintended to \"encourage economic development in the \\nterritories\", As Israeli journalists point out, all permits \\nfor opening new businesses depend on a prior approval \\nby the Shin Bet. \"Behind all the professed goodwill there \\nis no desire to solve problems, just the attitude of a good \\ncolonialist, willing to do something for the benefit of the \\nnatives, but on condition that they behave nicely, do not \\nbecome rebellious, and never do anything against the \\ninterests of the metropolis, its economic interests \\nincluded,\" wrote Michal Sela in Davar in February. The \\ndevelopment of sub-contracted work in the Gaza Strip \\naccords perfectly with Sela\\'s diagnosis.\\n\\nSela also shows how exactly the economic controls work. \\n\"In all branches of the economy, lobbies have been set in \\nmotion for purposes of freeing Israeli production from \\nthe threat of any Palestinian competition. The method is \\nsimplicity itself. As soon as any Israeli producer succeeds \\nin persuading the government, or even the trade and \\nindustry minister alone, a military order is issued \\nprohibiting the export of a given produce to Israel. If this \\ndoes not suffice, a Palestinian factory may be denied a \\nlicence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse \\nits production.\" Among the most active of such lobbies is \\nthe agricultural one. It has succeeded in limiting exports \\nof Gazan vegetables (except for those grown by settlers) \\nnot only to Israel but also to Europe, where they \\notherwise might compete with Israeli exports.\\n\\nPerpetuaring apartheid\\n\\nLabour\\'s goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in \\nthe territories. The same goal is shared by the US, which \\notherwise could not support the Labour government so \\nfirmly. In my view one of the reasons the US feels \\nhappier about supporting Labour than Likud is its \\ngreater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive. This \\npoint was brought home by Ofer Shelah in Ma\\'ariv, who \\ndeplored the settlers\\' failure which he attributed to \\nLikud\\'s inefficiency. he showed that the peak yearly \\nsettlement growth \"occured during the term of office of \\nthe National Unity government (i.e. 1984-90) in which \\nRabin served throughout as the defence minister\". \\nLikud\\'s reputation for settling the territories better than \\nLabour is false, attributable to the many tiny settlements \\nwithout strategic value founded under Shamir for \\nsymbolic reasons.\\n\\nTo sum up: Labour\\'s policy, unconditionally supported by \\nthe US differs from that of Likud primarily in the \\nefficiency with which it is implemented. According to \\nthat policy the territories are to be divided into two \\nparts. The major part is to be ruled by Israel directly, \\nand the minor part indirectly. In my view, this racist \\nscheme is doomed to ultimately fail, but at a horrifying \\nprice in human suffering. The sooner its true nature is \\nrecognised, the less suffering it may cause.',\n",

       " '\\n\\nThere was an article in USA today a few months ago showing the results\\nof a study that actually only about 1% were homosexual.  I saw another\\nfigure that listed 2% as the figure.  Of course, even if it were 99%\\nthat would have little bearing on whether or not it is a sinful behavior.\\nHow many people have commited other acts of fornication?  How many\\npeople have lied or sinned in other ways?\\n\\n\\nWhy isn\\'t it a specific feature of homosexuality?  Paul describes\\n\"men with men working that which is unseemly\" to describe the acts.  \\nSure, there spirtual nature was depraved also, and like the other\\nsins, the idolatry, the other sexual immoraity, and the other sins\\nsprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of \\nman\\'s not glorifying God as God and being thankful.  Still, their\\nacts were shameless.\\n\\n\\nIs everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the New Testament?\\nScripture does not condemn being a drug dealer.  Being ruled by the\\nSpirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism, it also\\nprotects us from sins that are against the Spirit.  The word is a\\ntwo edged sword that cuts both ways.  \\n\\nI think we must be careful before we totally throw out Leviticus.  \\nIf the Law is reflection of God\\'s character and true holy nature, then\\nthose who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a problem.  \\nIf homosexuality were \"natural\" (whatever that means) wholesome, \\nendorsed by God, and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow-minded\\nbiggots, as some would have us believe, why is there a condemnation of\\nit in Leviticus.  This condemnation is in the midst of all the other\\nsex sin condemnations, and there is nothing in the text to say that this\\nlaw was limited to temple prostitution, and no good reason to believe that\\nthis was the case.  Furthermore, male homosexual sex was a death-penalty\\ncrime!  \\n\\nIs every sin elaborated on in the New Testament?  Take a look at\\nI Corinthians 5.  Paul said that one of the Corinthians had broken a\\nlaw not even heard of among the Gentiles, that one should have his father\\'s\\nwife.  There is a prohibition against having your father\\'s wife in \\nLeviticus.  No other new Testament verse clearly condemns it (besides\\nthis one.)  Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commiting\\nadultery, etc.- he spoke against having one\\'s father\\'s wife.  \\n\\nNotice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentioned\\nin the specific context of paganism either.  And there was no pagan \\ncoustom mentioned in I corinthians either.  As a matter of fact\\ntaking one\\'s father\\'s wife wasn\\'t even done among the Gentiles.  It was\\njust a plain blantant sin, whether worshipping idols was involved or\\nnot.\\n\\n\\nOne of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument\\nis because Paul probably did face this and other problems.  Sin can\\nbe tough to over come, especially without supernatural power.  Is\\nhomosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin,\\nlike lusting after a married woman, or sleeping around with people of\\nthe opposite sex?  I doubt it, and even if it is, that is no excuse.\\nGod is greater than all of it. \\n\\nAnother reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural\\npower of God to intervene in this kind of situation.  How many \\npeople have been set free from sin by the power of God?  Sure there\\nmay be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed.\\nThat is a reflection on the people involved in the program, and not\\nGod\\'s willingness and ability to change a sinner.  Any program that\\nuses formulas may fail.  What people need is the power of God to\\nchange them, whether they are involved in homosexual sin, or any other\\nsin.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t see how you come to that conclusion.  Paul\\'s dealings with\\npastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order\\nto spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because it\\nwas just too difficult.  Take the example of eating meat offered to idols.\\nPaul felt that there was nothing wrong, in an abstract sense, with\\neating the meat.  Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty\\nto eat meat in order to spare others.  \\n\\nBut Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to\\ntough.  Paul wrote to \"make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts\\nthereof.\"  (Romans 13:14)  Then he goes in to a discourse on how we\\nshould sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others.\\n\\nSuppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts.  \\nSince others consider it to be a sin, then using Paul\\'s approach\\non pastorial issues, those who would otherwise be homosexuals should \\nsacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a\\nmember of the opposite sex.  Paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual\\n\"marriage\") to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered \\na more damaging sin.\\n\\n\\nYet marriage itself is not a sin.  marriage is holy in all- and something\\nthat God ordains, and Paul recognizes this.\\n\\n\\nActually, Adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell.\\nAfter he fell he would have to toil over the ground.\\n\\n\\nThat is why we are dependent totally on God- what a vunerable and glorious\\nposition to be it.  We all must be transformed by the renewing of our\\nminds- and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom, just\\nlike anyone else.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this \\nconclusion.  It\\'s like saying, \"How should I kill myself, with gun or\\naresenic?  What about the person who just is overcome with a desire to\\nsleep with goats?  Would it be better for him to sleep with one goat,\\nor all of them?  What about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts?\\nWould it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them?  \\n\\nIn all these cases, the more people or animals one sleeps with, the higher\\nthe chance that they will get a disease.  But this only deals with \\nphysical aspects of the question.  Whichever sin is commited, it all \\nleads to spiritual death.\\n\\n\\nThe issue that is most often addressed in Scripture seems to be the\\nactual act.  Second, isn\\'t it historical snobbery to say that\\nonly homosexuals of this century are capable of having \"loving\\nrelationships?\"  There are ancient writings glorifying homosexual \"love.\"\\n(btw, I am one who believes in refraining from making oathes.

When an\\ninfant is born (or conceived) a new life is begun--but it is neither\\ninnocent nor righteous.  Similarly when that same individual is\\nbaptized, or perhaps when they believe prior to baptism, they begin a\\nnew life in Christ (Romans 6:3, Colossians 2:12, Titus 3:5, Ephesians\\n2:5).

Some restrict the term\\'s meaning to \"active male\\nprostititute,\" but stronger evidence supports a more general translation,\\nnamely \"homosexuals.\"  More recently the definition \"homosexual\" has been\\nopposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term\\n\"homosexuals\" is anachronistic.  In addition, criticism of the traditional\\nrendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes\\nheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals. \\nA concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only\\nfactor in the ancient world.  The foregoing oppositition to the translation of\\narsenokoitai by \"homosexuals\" has a number of debilitating weaknesses. \\nFinally, this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it\\nfrom the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation\\nand behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline\\n(I Cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 Tim 1:8-11).\\n\\n                      *************************************\\n\\n                                   INTRODUCTION\\n\\n     Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has\\nbeen an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or\\nsodomy.    As part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used\\ntwice by the apostle Paul (1 Cor 6:9,  I Tim 1:10), has received vigorous\\nscrutiny.    This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since\\nso much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements.  More particularly, \\nthe concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church\\nand in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.\\n\\n     This study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and\\nevalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence\\nto point to a resolution.  Several writers and their positions represent the\\nmodern debate on this word.  Three authors, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs, have\\nprovoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider\\nacceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the\\nministry. \\n',\n",

His idea is \\nthat there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer\\nsolar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind;\\nover time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most got\\nscattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter\\nand Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially\\nUranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune -\\nwe call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller,\\nalready-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through\\nNeptune\\'s atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].\\n\\n  He notes that the two recently discovered \"Kuiper Belt\" objects,\\n1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same \\nmass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the\\nlarger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks,\\nformed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material\\ninto a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to\\nideas about the formation of Earth\\'s moon.  There is good evidence\\nfrom spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different\\n(Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn\\'t), which can be used as evidence\\nfor the impact theory.\\n\\n  He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects\\nremaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune\\'s \\norbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members\\nof this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies\\nwill be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane \\nfrost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons\\nby now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think)\\nis that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate,\\nand when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms\\nbright, new frost.

Since it hasn\\'t\\nbeen posted for some time (and I\\'ve modified it somewhat since the\\nlast time), I\\'m taking this opportunity to post it.  There is another\\nentry in the FAQ containing comments by some other contributors.  They\\ncan be retrieved from ftp.rutgers.edu as\\npub/soc.religion.christian/others/homosexuality.  It contains far\\nmore detail on the exegetical issues than I give here, though\\nprimarily from a conservative point of view.\\n\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThis posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and\\nChristians.  This is a frequently asked question, so I do not post the\\nquestion each time it occurs.  Rather this is an attempt to summarize\\nthe postings we get when we have a discussion.  It summarizes\\narguments for allowing Christian homosexuality, since most people\\nasking the question already know the arguments against it.  The most\\ncommon -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is \"how can a\\nChristian justify being a homosexual, given what the Bible says about\\nit?\"\\n\\nFirst, on the definition of \\'homosexual\\'.  Many groups believe that\\nthere is a homosexual \"orientation\", i.e. a sexual attraction to\\nmembers of the same sex.  This is distinguished from actual homosexual\\nsexual activity.  Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by\\nmost groups to be acceptable.  However in a lot of discussion, the\\nterm \\'homosexual\\' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex.\\nThis is generally not accepted outside the most \\'liberal\\' groups.  In\\nthis paper I\\'m going to use \\'homosexual\\' as meaning a person engaging\\nin sexual acts with another of the same sex.  I haven\\'t heard of any\\nBiblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who\\nremains celebate.\\n\\nI think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be\\nhomosexual.  This is often called a \\'homosexual orientation\\'.  It is\\nnot known whether it is genetic or environmental.  There is evidence\\nsuggesting each.  The best evidence I\\'ve seen is that homosexuality is\\nnot a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes.  One of\\nthem is probably genetic.  There are several groups that try to help\\npeople move from being homosexual to heterosexual.  The best-known is\\nExodus International\".  The reports I\\'ve seen (and I haven\\'t read the\\ndetailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to the\\nPresbyterian Church\\'s infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that\\nthese programs have very low success rates, and that there are\\nquestions about how real even the successes are.  But there certainly\\nare people who say they have converted.  However this issue is not as\\nimportant as it sounds.  Those who believe homosexuality is wrong\\nbelieve it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God.  The fact\\nthat it\\'s hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant\\nthan the fact that it\\'s hard to escape from being a drug addict.  If\\nit\\'s wrong, it\\'s wrong.  It may affect how we deal with people though.\\nIf it\\'s very difficult to change, this may tend to make us more\\nwilling to forgive it.\\n\\nOne more general background issue: It\\'s common to quote a figure that\\n10% of the population is homosexual.  I asked one of our experts where\\nthis came from.  Here\\'s his response: Kinsey (see below) is the source\\nof the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not by\\norientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely\\nheterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).  According to Kinsey,\\none-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of\\norgasm homosexually post puberty.  Ten percent of all adult males have\\nmost of their experiences of homosexually.  That was in 1948.  The\\npercentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey\\nInstitute, based on data in the early seventies but not published\\nuntil the early 80s or so, by Bell and Weinberg, I believe.  I can\\'t\\nput my hand on this latter reference, but here is the online\\ninformation for Kinsey\\'s own study as it appears in IRIS, the catalog\\nat Rutgers:\\n   AUTHOR Kinsey, Alfred Charles, 1894-1956.\\n    TITLE Sexual behavior in the human male [by] Alfred C.

A\\njournalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting\\nher book that allegedly refutes Kinsey\\'s study, but the scholarly\\nworld seems to take her for a kook......\\n\\nI\\'ve seen some objections to the Kinsey\\'s study, but not in enough\\ndetail to include here.  (If someone would like to contribute another\\nview, I\\'d be willing to include it.)\\n\\nMost Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong.\\nNot all, however.  A few denominations accept it.  The Metropolitan\\nCommunity Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to\\naccept homosexuals.  However the United Church of Christ also allows\\nit, and I think a couple of other groups may as well.  The Episcopal\\nChurch seems to accept it some areas but not others.  In churches that\\nhave congregational government, you\\'ll find a few congregations that\\naccept it (even among Southern Baptists, though the number is probably\\nonly one or two congregations).  But these are unusual -- few churches\\npermit homosexual church leaders.  How carefully they enforce this is\\nanother issue.  I don\\'t have any doubt that there are homosexual\\npastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others.\\n\\nAs to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues, here\\'s an\\nattempt to summarize the issues:\\n\\nThe most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of\\nhomosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell:\\n\"Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality\", U Chicago Press,\\n1980.\\n\\nThe argument against is pretty clear.  There are several explicit laws\\nin the OT, e.g. Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative on\\nhomosexuality.  Beyond these references, there are some debates.  Some\\npassages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant.  E.g.\\nthe sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was\\nhomosexual *rape*, not homosexual activity between consenting adults.\\n(There\\'s even some question whether it was homosexual, since the\\nentities involved were angels.)  It was particularly horrifying\\nbecause it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests in\\nthat culture was very strong.  (This is probably the reason Lot\\noffered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to\\nallow his guests to be attacked.)  If you look through a concordance\\nfor references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible, you\\'ll see that few\\nseem to imply that homosexuality was their sin.  There\\'s a Jewish\\ninterpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests.  At any\\nrate, there\\'s no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong.\\n\\nI do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set\\nof laws that most Christians do not consider binding.  So unless NT\\njustification can be found, Lev. alone would not settle the issue.\\n\\nThe NT references are all in Paul\\'s letters.  A number of the\\nreferences from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly\\nvague.  Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not\\nin the lists (i.e. I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and\\n/arsenokoitai/.  Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words\\nactually mean.  /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a variety\\nof metaphorical meanings in ethical writing.  Boswell suggests\\n\"wanton\" as a likely equivalent.  He also reports that the unanimous\\ninterpretation of the Church, including Greek-speaking Christians, was\\nthat in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that has\\nvanished only in the 20th Cent., as that practice has come to be less\\nfrowned-upon.  (He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the\\nCatholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.)  He\\ntranslates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that none\\nof the church fathers understood the term as referring to\\nhomosexuality in general.  A more technical meaning, suggested by the\\nearly Latin translations, would be \"active mode homosexual male\\nprostitute\", but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically.\\n\\nFor a more conservative view, I consulted Gordon Fee\\'s commentary on I\\nCor.  He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate.\\nHowever Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not\\nnecessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associated\\nwith some kinds of homosexual behavior.  Given what Boswell and Fee\\nsay taken together, I suspect that the term is simply not very\\ndefinite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, it\\nisn\\'t a general term for homosexuality.  While Fee argues against\\nBoswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting a\\ntranslation that seems essentially the same.  The big problem with it\\nis that the word is almost never used.  Paul\\'s writing is the first\\noccurence.  The fact that the word is clearly composed of \"male\" and\\n\"f**k\" unfortunately doesn\\'t quite tell us the meaning, since it\\ndoesn\\'t tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the\\naction.  Examples of compound words formed either way can be given.\\nIn theory it could refer to rapists, etc.  It\\'s dangerous to base\\nmeaning purely on etymology, or you\\'ll conclude that \"goodbye\" is a\\nreligious expression because it\\'s based on \"God by with ye\".  However\\nsince Boswell, Fee, and NIV seem to agree on \"homosexual male\\nprostitute\", that seems as good a guess as any.  Note that this\\ntranslation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something\\nwhich Fee and Boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce in\\ntheir translation).\\n\\nIn my opinion, the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans\\n1.  Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something\\nthat happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a result\\nof their corruption due to worshipping false gods.  One could argue\\nthat this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped false\\ngods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become\\nheterosexual.  However I find this argument somewhat forced, and in\\nfact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is\\nwhat Paul meant.\\n\\nHowever I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a law\\nagainst homosexuality for Christians.  What Paul is describing in Rom\\n1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- it\\'s homosexuality that\\nappeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness.\\nDespite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, I\\'m sure Paul\\ndoes not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex.\\nGiven his description of their situation, I rather assume that their\\nheterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless.  So yes, I do\\nbelieve that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality.\\nBut in all fairness, the \"shameless\" nature of their acts is a\\nreflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a\\nspecific feature of homosexuality.\\n\\nMy overall view of the situation is the following: I think we have\\nenough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of\\nhomosexuality.  Rom 1 seems clear.  While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 are\\nnot unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they do\\nnot seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of\\nhomosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the\\nother hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the\\nsubject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality\\nin passing.\\n\\nThe result of this situation is that people interpret these passages\\nin light of their general approach to Scripture.  For those who look\\nto Scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprising\\nthat they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT\\nprohibition.  For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal,\\nit is not surprising that they regard Paul\\'s negative view of\\nhomosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing\\nwithout any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel.  As\\nreaders of this group know by now, the assumptions behind these\\napproaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the\\nmouth when they see the opposing view described.  There\\'s not a lot I\\ncan do as moderator about such a situation.\\n\\nA number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of\\ndetailed exegesis of texts that is described above.  However in fact\\nI\\'m not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their\\nown beliefs on such analyses.  The real issue seems to rest on the\\nquestion of whether Paul\\'s judgement should apply to modern\\nhomosexuality.\\n\\nOne commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds\\nof questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality\\nonly in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was\\nwrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act\\n\"straight\" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying\\nto define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian\\nideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the\\nrelationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul\\'s\\njudgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make\\njudgements on these questions.\\n\\nAnother is the following: In Paul\\'s time homosexuality was associated\\nwith a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable.  It\\nwas part of temple prostitution.  Among private citizens, it often\\noccured between adults and children or free people and slaves.  I\\'m\\nnot in a position to say that it always did, but there are some\\nreasons to think so.  The ancients distinguished between the active\\nand passive partner.  It was considered disgraceful for a free adult\\nto act as the passive partner.  (This is the reason that an active\\nmode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful.  His\\ncustomers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.)  This\\nsupports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two\\nfree adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal.\\nClearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children,\\nslaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible\\npartners.  (However Fee\\'s commentary on I Cor cites some examples from\\nancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve\\nfree adults in a reasonably symmetrical way.  Thus the considerations\\nin this paragraph shouldn\\'t be pushed too far.  Homosexuality may have\\nbeen discredited for Jews by some of these associations, but there\\nsurely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not\\ninvolve slaves or children.)\\n\\nSome people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against\\nhomosexuality.  I\\'d like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by\\npromiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual.  Someone who has a\\nhomosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is\\nnot at risk for AIDS.\\n\\nNote that there is good reason from Paul\\'s general approach to doubt\\nthat he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative,\\napart from any specific statements on homosexuality.  I believe his\\nuse of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual\\nmarriage as what God ordained.\\n\\nHowever the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning\\nagainst being too quick to deal with this issue legally.\\n\\nI claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is\\nnot entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul\\'s\\ntendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating\\nholidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues\\nto look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to\\navoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.\\nFor example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat\\nmeat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about\\nwhich they had personal qualms.  For another example, Paul obviously\\nwould have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)\\nremain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly\\nwould rather see them married than in a state where they might be\\ntempted to fornication.\\n\\nI believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the\\nviews Paul expressed in Rom 1.  One may believe that homosexuality is\\nnot what God intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but still\\nconclude that at times we have to live with it.  Note that in the\\ncreation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This\\ndoesn\\'t mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.  The\\nquestion is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful\\nor whether you believe that it\\'s a misfortune that is in a broad sense\\ndue to human sinfulness.  If you\\'re willing to consider the latter\\napproach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more\\ndamage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it.\\nThe dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often\\nfails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from\\npsychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when\\nattempts at living as a heterosexual fail.\\n\\nThis is going to depend upon one\\'s assessment of the inherent nature\\nof homosexuality.  If you believe it is a very serious wrong, then you\\nmay be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it.\\nClearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency\\nto steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure these\\nconditions are also very difficult.  However these conditions are\\nintrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for\\nhomosexuality.  (Many problems associated with homosexuality are\\nactually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality.  This includes\\nAIDS.  I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual\\nrelationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent\\nto Christian heterosexual relationships.)\\n\\nIn the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, we\\'ve\\nheard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in\\nthis situation.  I\\'ve also seen summaries of various research and the\\nresults of various efforts for \"conversion\".  (Aside from the\\nPresbyterian report mentioned above, there\\'s an FAQ that summarizes\\nour readers\\' reports on this question.)  The evidence is that\\nlong-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a\\npar with healing miracles.  The danger in advising Christians to\\ndepend upon such a change is clear: When \"conversion\" doesn\\'t happen,\\nwhich is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling\\nexcluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement\\nof life-long celibacy.  Paul recognized (though in a different\\ncontext) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and I\\nthink the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that\\njudgement.  The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay\\nsex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality.  Maybe\\nhomosexuality isn\\'t God\\'s original ideal, but I can well imagine Paul\\npreferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian\\nrelationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis\\nsuggests wasn\\'t part of God\\'s original ideal either -- I think such\\nrelationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God\\'s love\\nwith each other.\\n\\nThere\\'s an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this\\ndiscussion.  The issue is that of \"cultural relativism\".  That is,\\nwhen Paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as an\\neternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situations\\nin the culture of the time?  Conservative Christians generally insist\\non taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the Bible becomes\\nsubjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as\\nrelative?\\n\\nWhen looking at this issue, it\\'s worth noting that no one completely\\nrejects the concept of cultural relativism.  There are a number of\\njudgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians\\nconsider to be relative.  The following judgements are at least as\\nclear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality:\\n\\n  - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in\\n\\tthe OT -- it\\'s not in the NT, but I mention it here because\\n\\tuntil relatively recently the Church did consider it binding\\n\\ton Christians)\\n  - prohibition against swearing oaths\\n  - endorsement of slavery as an institution\\n  - judgement of tax collectors as sinner\\n\\nWe do not regard these items as binding.  In most cases, I believe the\\nargument is essentially one of cultural relativism.  Briefly:\\n\\n  - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific\\n\\tagrarian society that the Bible was trying to build,\\n\\tbut not to our market economy.\\n  - few people believe that American judicial oaths have the\\n\\tsame characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was\\n\\tconcerned about\\n  - most people believe that Paul was simply telling people\\n\\thow to live within slavery, but not endorsing it as\\n\\tan institution\\n  - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to\\n\\tRoman tax farming\\n\\nThe point I\\'m trying to make is that before applying Biblical\\nprohibitions to the 20th Cent., we need to look at whether the 20th\\nCent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their\\nrelationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul\\nwould have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of\\nargument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.\\nUntil fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest, and\\nmany Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed.  (Indeed,\\nslavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship\\nbetween God and human beings -- Christians are often called servants\\nor slaves of God.)\\n\\nI am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally\\nrelative.  Rather, I\\'m trying to say that *some* things are, and\\ntherefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in\\nthe Bible, that ends the discussion.  We need to look at whether the\\naction we\\'re talking about now has the same moral implications as the\\none that the Bible was talking about.  If Christians want to argue\\nthat there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against\\nhomosexuality are still binding, I\\'m willing to listen.  Those who\\nclaim that the question doesn\\'t need to be looked at are kidding\\nthemselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey\\nall the rules listed above).\\n\\nOne thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue\\ncreates.  When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence --\\nsome laws in Leviticus, a passage in Rom whose subject matter is\\nreally idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whose\\nwords are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among\\nChristians seems rather out of proportion.  This should suggest to\\npeople that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved.\\nThis is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are as\\nstrongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments\\nas conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments.  But I\\ncan\\'t help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way\\nof justifying attitudes which come from other sources.  This is a\\ndangerous situation for Christians.\\n\\nOn the other side of the issue, I would like to note some problems I\\nhave with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented.\\nOne of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically\\ndetermined.  I.e. \"God made me homosexual\", and I have no choice.  I\\nthink \"God made me homosexual\" is a fine view for people who already\\nbelieve on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable.  But I\\ndon\\'t see it as an argument for acceptability.',\n",

Previously I\\nhad been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU\\nbut this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds.\\n\\nYour mileage may vary. The top speed you achieve cannot be predicted\\nbefore hand. My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far.\\nI didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher\\nspeeds.\\n\\nParts\\n\\n\\tClock Oscillators (4 pin TTL variety) You will need a selection of\\n\\tspeeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. The CPU will run at 1/2 the\\n\\toscillator speed. The original one is a 50 mhz unit. I recommend\\n\\tgetting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one.\\n\\n\\t   I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for\\n\\t   less than $5.00 each. Some of their part numbers are:\\n\\n\\t\\t   50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X121)\\n\\t\\t   62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X136)\\n\\t\\t   66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # CTX137)\\n\\n\\t   Don't get the half size clock oscillators. They won't fit.\\n\\n\\t   There are also CMOS clock oscillators. I haven't tried one in a\\n\\t   Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi's)\\n\\t   \\n\\tSocket: Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as\\n\\t   a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins\\n\\t   from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket.\\n\\n\\tCooling Fan: A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a \\n\\t   must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had\\n\\t   a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which\\n\\t   tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up \\n\\t   something similar or risk frying your CPU.\\n\\t   \\nProcedure\\n\\n1)  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here.\\n\\n2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and\\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\\n    this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from\\n\\tthe back of the mac.\\n \\n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\\n    need release.\\n \\n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\\n    to release it.\\n                                            \\n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\\n\\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\\n    here.\\n\\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\\n\\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\\n\\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\\n\\n8)  Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic\\n    device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle,\\n\\trear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release.\\n\\t\\n9)  Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to\\n    free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case.\\n\\t\\n10) Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of\\n    the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plastic\\n\\tPower light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. The\\n\\tmotherboard then comes directly out.\\n\\t\\n11) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the\\n    CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillators\\n\\tmust be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation.\\n\\t\\n\\tVery carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some of\\n\\tthe pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sure\\n\\tyour desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board.\\n\\t\\n\\tI used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This is\\n\\tNOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard is\\n\\ta multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without\\n\\tproper care.\\n\\t\\n12) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was.\\n\\n13) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use the\\n\\told clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside the\\n\\tsocket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new\\n\\t50 mhz clock.\\n\\t\\n14) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification.\\n\\t\\n14) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place.\\n\\n15) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother\\n    board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard.\\n\\t\\n16) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\\n\\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\\n\\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\\n    into place.\\n\\t\\n17) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\\n    DRIVE CABLE.\\n\\n18) Replace the phillips head screw\\n\\n19) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\\n\\n20) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount.\\n\\n21) Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn \\n    on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn't,\\n\\tsomething is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck your\\n\\thandiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences.\\n\\t\\n\\tHopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off and\\n\\treplace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot and\\n\\tbe astounded. \\n\\t\\n\\tYou will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding\\n\\ta particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-up\\n\\tmight take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time since\\n\\tmodifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a single\\n\\tproblem.\\n\\t\\nGood Luck to all who attempt this modification.

       " '(Book Review):\\n          \\n          \\n          \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North \\n          Pacific Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 456 pages, indexed, \\n          hardcover. \\n          \\n\\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to \\n          most ALL astrophysical mysteries. \\n          \\n               This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged \\n          edition of \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\", 1959.  \\n          Volume I is \"NOTHING BUT MOTION\" (1979), and Volume II is \\n          \"THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\" (1988). \\n          \\n               Most books and journal articles on the subject of \\n          astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial \\n          differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by \\n          contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except \\n          for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.  \\n          Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical \\n          agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual \\n          validity. \\n          \\n               Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor \\n          of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State \\n          University.  He developed the Theory described in his books \\n          while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the \\n          properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements \\n          they contain. \\n          \\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" describes the astrophysical \\n          portions of Larson\\'s CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE, \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of \\n          \"grand unified field theory\" that orthodox physicists and \\n          astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two \\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of \\n          space and time: \\n          \\n               (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \\n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \\n          units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME. \\n          \\n               (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of \\n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are \\n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN. \\n          \\n               From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a \\n          COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic \\n          particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the \\n          concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with \\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-\\n          vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was \\n          able to match parts of his theoretical universe with \\n          corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including \\n          EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959 \\n          book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES, \\n          several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They \\n          are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And \\n          when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation \\n          ready for those also. \\n          \\n               As a result of his theory, which he called \"THE \\n          RECIPROCAL SYSTEM\", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the \\n          sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists, \\n          including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter, \\n          quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure), \\n          \"nuclear\" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass \\n          increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in \\n          stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be \\n          nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very \\n          critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles, \\n          solutions in principle, \"no other way\" declarations, etc., \\n          used to maintain them. \\n          \\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" is divided into 31 chapters.  \\n          It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from \\n          the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters, \\n          which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that \\n          accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in \\n          from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy \\n          formation from the MYTHICAL \"big bang\" is a big mystery to \\n          orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life \\n          cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and \\n          solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of \\n          SINGLE stars. \\n          \\n               Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according \\n          to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have \\n          been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies \\n          and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT \\n          (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME). \\n          \\n               Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against \\n          observations that contradict their theories would find \\n          Larson\\'s explanations quite valuable if considered with an \\n          OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY \\n          BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the \\n          plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray \\n          telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from \\n          ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any \\n          visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional \\n          coincidence).  Larson\\'s explanation is that the gamma ray \\n          bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER \\n          HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the \"cosmic \\n          sector\".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a \\n          RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed \\n          of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE \\n          dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the \\n          bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly \\n          at random. \\n          \\n               Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from \\n          books, journal articles, and leading physicists and \\n          astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted \\n          with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the \\n          end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book \\n          \"Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey\", by William K. Hartmann, \\n          says, \"Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if \\n          we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars \\n          form.... Unfortunately we cannot.\"  Larson\\'s book contains \\n          LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are \\n          WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists, \\n          astronomers, and astrophysicists. \\n\\n\\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \\n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (Larson\\'s BOOKS). \\n\\n\\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \\n          IMPORTANT Book Review is ENCOURAGED. \\n',\n",

       " \"Interesting delema for all those out there.\\nMy school is discussing installing a Mac lab of 10 to 15 stations for our Bio\\n100 to 103 classes to do a study with pig disections.  (no joke)  Here is the\\ndeal. We can get this grant to do a study on if it is more feasible to do a\\ndisection via the computer or via the real thing.  My problem is I was somehow\\ndrawn into this project (being done by students who want to go Mac but know\\nNADA about them, being the man mac man on campus, guess who they came to?) so I\\nwnt to know what would probably be the best hardware to fill the follwoing\\nlist?  Right now we are looking at the C650 8/80 and the 2vx 5/80 platforms.\\nOk here it goes:\\n\\n\\tWe are using cd-rom, so ought we go with the internal Apple Cd-roms\\noffered as options in the 650 and vx or go external. It is a matter of price\\nand reliability, the second being VERY important.\\n\\tHow much RAM?  I was thinking 5-8 more leaning towards 8?  What do you\\nthink?\\n\\tOk, called apple educational discounts and they said their keyboard\\n(extended) is 160.30. Is it better to go with the Apple and their long time\\ngreat wear and tear record, or is there a 3rd party extended keyboard that is\\njust a reliable?  Price?\\n\\tPrinters:  One color printer we are presently leaning towrds the\\nThermal Wax Tektronic 200e or 200i (Probably the e as we are going to limit\\naccess so we don't needed the i's networkability)  So, what do you think in\\nterms of color printers?  Different brand?  Kind (Dye Sublimation?  Ink Jet?) \\nPrice? Companies?  1800 #s?  Also, we are looking to get a laser printer or\\nsuch to network into the whole lab for noraml printing.  The fornt runner is\\nthe Apple Pro650 (is that right don't have my notes here?) at 1650. \\nSuggestions?  We have kids using these things all day if this lab goes through\\nand they know nothing about it for the most part. It has to be reliable, easy\\nto maintain, and economical (ie, not high priced paper cartidges, etc).\\n\\tFinally, and this is my little dig into the Project. What about netting\\nthese things?  We have ether nearby and I would like to slap the macs on the\\nnet, but, server?  Individual ether?  Forget about it it is going to be\\nastronomically priced and the school is going to laugh at you when you ask\\nthem?\\n\\tLittle more info, I am a Poli Sci major who just happens to know alot\\nabout macs but this is a bit out of my league, not to mention I don't have the\\ntime to go and look for all of this stuff.

       " '\\n\\nThough this will be addressed in the series of articles I\\'m posting now under\\n\"ARESNOKOITIA\", I can\\'t wait.  This just really blew my socks off.  Read I Tim\\n1: 3-11.  Verses 3-8 speaks against those who have perverted the teachings of\\nthe Mosaic Law.  In vv.9-10, we have, *IN ORDER*, the 5th thru the 9th\\ncommandments and in the midst of this listing is \"homosexuals.\"  The decalogue,\\nabove everything else, is seen as God\\'s absolute.  If you don\\'t believe in\\nabsolutes, then you have nothing do do with Jehovah of the OT, which Paul\\nreveals to be the Messiah of the NT. \"Lord Christ Jesus\" transliterates to read\\n\"Jehovah\\'s Anointed Savior.\"  \\n  In I Cor5, we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagan\\ngentiles as we do in Lev 18-20.  In I Cor 6:9-10, only one notation (drunkards)\\nis not found in Lev 18-20.  Paul was not naive in his use of the LXX.  He knew\\nfull well how he was using the Law of God that was given in the OT, for\\napplication in the NT.  As I\\'ve said, the Law was fulfilled, not done away\\nwith.\\n\\n\\nThis understanding is thoroughly rebutted in DeYoungs article that is being\\nposted.  Please refer to it.\\n\\n\\nWe can do better than \"probably\" which is not an adequate defense against the\\nstatement that Paul\\'s culture didn\\'t have the same understanding of\\nhomosexuality as ours.  \\nAgain read the article because it uses facts.\\n\\n\\nI think I do, because I have worked in the homosexual community by means of\\nworking with AIDs patients.  The pastoral is merely the practical application\\nof the theological truth however.  Those who are working thru the issue of\\nhomosexuality need to have our love and understanding just as with a friend who\\nis contiplating cheating on his wife or a friend who lives with his girlfriend,\\nyet you continue to witness to him.  But, once the choice is made, and there is\\nno remorse, then I feel that Paul\\'s \"pastoral\" care, as presented in the\\nCorinthian Church, come to bear significance.  THe one in active rebellion\\nshould be placed outside of the church if a believer, and if a non-believer,\\nthen one wipes his sandels and leaves it in Gods hand.  If there was a member\\nin your youth group who was constantly pawing at the little girls, you wouldn\\'t\\nhesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly.  That, in part, betrays\\nthe present \"political correctness\" of the issue.  Pederasty is not accepted at\\nthe present, but some how we are to accept homosexuality because the latter is\\npolitically correct, while the former is not -at least not yet.  THis is how\\nthe morals decay.  \\n\\nI guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm of\\neconomics.  The liberals want to tax the rich in the federal, yet in their own\\nstates, when they try to get businesses to settle there, they give tax\\nincentives to these same richies.  It comes down to a moral code of\\nrelativeness, or to use the cultural thing, politically correct -at the moment.\\n--Rex',\n",

       " 'Several weeks ago, I described a problem with my Apple High-Resolution\\nmonitor and promised to summarize replies received by e-mail.

Sometimes, though, it happens\\nwith no provocation whatsoever.\\n\\nI have received a bewildering range of replies. At one extreme was\\na man, clearly quite knowledgable about monitors, who said that the\\nproblem was that the 13\" monitor\\'s power supply simply couldn\\'t always\\nkeep up with sudden changes of the raster image; the rapid change from\\na largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor\\'s\\npower supply.

       " 'John E. King (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner:\\n\\n * \"The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be *\\n *  treated as a matter of faith.\" -- Francis Hitching                     *\\n\\n  I have a few points to make about the above posting.\\n\\n    1. Science is not based on and does not consist of \"quotes\" from either\\n    real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)\\n    experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive\\n    confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike\\n    (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to\\n    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests\\n    that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they\\n    are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a\\n    creationist and this may not be your real intent.\\n\\n    2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his\\n    statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the\\n    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.\\n    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context\\n    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate\\n    scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may\\n    not be your real intent.\\n\\n    3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of \"the modern theory of\\n    evolution\" would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one\\n    line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that\\n    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate\\n    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck\\n    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond\\n    of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not\\n    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.\\n\\n    4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack\\n    on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on\\n    science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the\\n    fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long\\n    ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and\\n    irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a\\n    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.\\n\\n\\nWarren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:\\n\\n * Neither I, nor Webster\\'s has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *\\n\\n  I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Webster\\'s B^).  Francis Hitchings\\nis a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the\\npart of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution (\"The Neck of\\nthe Giraffe\").  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton)\\nusing the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could\\nnot have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution\\n(the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a \"non sequitur\" (i.e.\\nthe conclusion \"does not follow\"). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes Richard\\nLewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]\\n\\n  Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber\\nin the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article was\\ntitled \"`Giraffe\\' sticks scientific neck out too far\".  Excerpts include :\\n\\n  \"Francis Hitchings is not a biologist.\"  \"He goes after Darwin like Mark\\n  Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and\\n  pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman.\"  \"He suggests\\n  a mystical `organizing principle\\' of life, using the similarity of organs\\n  in different creatures as evidence [sic].\"\\n\\n  Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not\\nagainst it.  If John E. King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn\\'t\\nsurprise me much.  It\\'s also interesting that King had nothing to add (i.e.\\nhe only posted a quote).\\n',\n",

A few years ago, I did some calculations on a\\n\"Grand Tour\" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt \\nthat\\nthe idea of a big \"mother ship\" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather\\nsmall, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan\\nIII/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael\\'s?) had a lot in\\ncommon with the British Interplanetary Society\\'s Daedalus project for sending a\\nprobe to Barnard\\'s Star - i.e. a large \"bus\" spacecraft carrying several\\nsmaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination.\\nThe Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards\\nJupiter and beyond. The \"bus\" could have included far more powerful\\ncameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power\\nsource than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore.\\nExtremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements\\nwithin a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a\\nrelatively great distance.\\n---\\nThe smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the \"real\" Voyagers,\\nand an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in\\nthe early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during\\nthe mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the\\nsame basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in\\naddition two \"sub-probes\" could have been relased at Saturn, examining\\nthat planet\\'s south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have\\nenabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several\\nother probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune\\nsystems that weren\\'t examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to\\ntrajectory-related factors. A small \"swarm\" of camera-equipped miniature space\\nprobes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a \\nsmall Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, \\nwell-equipped spacecraft.

It almost sounds like marriage disqualifies\\none for salvation.  (Matthew and Mark both omit this statement.)   I\\nthink the accounts are not as clear as they might be.  Let\\'s have a\\nlook at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable\\nideas of what it means.  The scriptures involved are Mat 22:23-30,\\nMark 12:18-25, and Luke 20:27-36.\\n\\nWhat happened was that the Sadducees, who did not believe in the\\nresurrection, thought they could trap Jesus.  They made reference to\\nthe \"Leverite\" marriage which required the brother of a man who died\\nwithout children to take the widow to wife and raise up children.  \\nThe children would be considered children of the deceased, just as\\nthough the woman\\'s first husband had fathered them.  It seems\\nobvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to be\\nthe wife of her first husband.  However, the Sadducees concocted a\\nscene in which 6 brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed to\\nfather children by the widow.  They seem to imply that the Leverite\\nmarriage was equal to the first for they ask, \"Whose wife shall she\\nbe in the resurrection?\"  At this point it seems obvious that if she\\nis anybody\\'s wife, it is the first husband.  After all, had she\\nborne children they would have been credited to him regardless of\\nwhich brother was the biological father.  It is possible Jesus was\\nrefering to this when he says, \"Ye do err, not knowing the\\nscriptures or the power of God.\" (Mat 22:29, compare Mark 12:24,\\nphrase not in Luke\\'s account).\\n\\nAnyway, the Sadducees ask, \"Whose wife will she be in the\\nresurrection, seeing that all 7 had her?\"  Jesus answer is that,\\n\"In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in\\nmarriage...\" (Mat 22:30) \"When they rise from the dead they neither\\nmarry...\" (Mark 12:25)  \"They which are accounted worthy to obtain\\nthat world neither marry...\" (Luke 20:35)  All 3 accounts go on to\\nsay, \"but are as the angels in heaven\" or the equivalent.  I find\\nthis last not very helpful since the Bible does not define angels\\nnor give any idea what their life is like.  (Some ministers claim\\nthat they are sexless, different that humans etc. but I can find no\\nBiblical support for this.)',\n",

The footnote \\nlists various Synods which endorsed lists of canonical \\nbooks, but then says \"The Tridentine list or decree was the\\nfirst *infallible* and effectually promulgated declaration\\non the Canon of the Holy Scriptures.\"\\n\\nWhich leads one to think that the RC canon was not official\\nuntil Trent.

This report\\n  covers events through March 31, 1993.  The last report, dated\\n  November 10, 1992, covered events through October 15, 1992.\\n\\n       1.  There have been no amendments to the Iranian\\n  Transactions Regulations (\"ITRs\"), 31 CFR Part 560, or to the\\n  Iranian Assets Control Regulations (\"IACRs\"), 31 CFR Part 535,\\n  since the last report.\\n\\n       2.  The Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"FAC\") of the\\n  Department of the Treasury continues to process applications\\n  for import licenses under the ITRs.  However, as previously\\n  reported, recent amendments to the ITRs have resulted in a\\n  substantial decrease in the number of applications received\\n  relating to the importation of nonfungible Iranian-origin goods.\\n\\n       During the reporting period, the Customs Service has\\n  continued to effect numerous seizures of Iranian-origin\\n  merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the import\\n  prohibitions of the ITRs.  FAC and Customs Service investi-\\n  gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions\\n  and the imposition of civil monetary penalties.  Additional\\n  forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review.\\n\\n       3.  The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (the\\n  \"Tribunal\"), established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers\\n  Accords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims\\n  before it.  Since the last report, the Tribunal has rendered\\n  12 awards, for a total of 545 awards.  Of that total, 367 have\\n  been awards in favor of American claimants:  222 of these were\\n  awards on agreed terms, authorizing and approving payment of\\n  settlements negotiated by the parties, and 145 were decisions\\n  adjudicated on the merits.  The Tribunal has issued 36 decisions\\n  dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing\\n  claims for jurisdictional reasons.  Of the 59 remaining awards,\\n  3 approved the withdrawal of cases, and 56 were in favor of\\n  Iranian claimants.  As of March 31, 1993, awards to successful\\n  American claimants from the Security Account held by the\\n  NV Settlement Bank stood at $2,340,072,357.77.\\n\\n       As of March 31, 1993, the Security Account has fallen\\n  below the required balance of $500 million 36 times.  Iran has\\n  periodically replenished the account, as required by the Algiers\\n  Accords, by transferring funds from the separate account held by\\n  the NV Settlement Bank in which interest on the Security Account\\n  is deposited.  Iran has also replenished the account with the\\n  proceeds from the sale of Iranian-origin oil imported into the\\n  United States, pursuant to transactions licensed on a case-by-\\n  case basis by FAC.  Iran has not, however, replenished the\\n  account since the last oil sale deposit on October 8, 1992.\\n  The aggregate amount that has been transferred from the Interest\\n  Account to the Security Account is $874,472,986.47.  As of\\n  March 31, 1993, the total amount in the Security Account was\\n  $216,244,986.03, and the total amount in the Interest Account\\n  was $8,638,133.15.\\n\\n       4.  The Tribunal continues to make progress in the\\n  arbitration of claims of U.S. nationals for $250,000.00 or more.\\n  Since the last report, nine large claims have been decided.\\n  More than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been\\n  disposed of through adjudication, settlement, or voluntary\\n  withdrawal, leaving 76 such claims on the docket.  The larger\\n  claims, the resolution of which has been slowed by their\\n  complexity, are finally being resolved, sometimes with sizable\\n  awards to the U.S. claimants.  For example, two claimants were\\n  awarded more than $130 million each by the Tribunal in October\\n  1992.\\n\\n       5.  As anticipated by the May 13, 1990, agreement settling\\n  the claims of U.S. nationals for less than $250,000.00, the\\n  Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (\"FCSC\") has continued its\\n  review of 3,112 claims.  The FCSC has issued decisions in\\n  1,201 claims, for total awards of more than $22 million.  The\\n  FCSC expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining\\n  claims in early 1994.\\n\\n       6.  In coordination with concerned Government agencies,\\n  the Department of State continues to present United States\\n  Government claims against Iran, as well as responses by the\\n  United States Government to claims brought against it by Iran.\\n  In November 1992, the United States filed 25 volumes of\\n  supporting information in case B/1 (Claims 2 & 3), Iran\\'s claim\\n  against the United States for damages relating to its Foreign\\n  Military Sales Program.  In February of this year, the United\\n  States participated in a daylong prehearing conference in\\n several other cases involving military equipment.  Iran also\\n  filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure\\n  of U.S. courts to enforce an award against a U.S. corporation\\n  violated the Algiers Accords.\\n\\n       7.  As reported in November, Jose Maria Ruda, President of\\n  the Tribunal, tendered his resignation on October 2, 1992.  No\\n  successor has yet been named.  Judge Ruda\\'s resignation will\\n  take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up\\n  his duties.\\n\\n       8.  The situation reviewed above continues to involve\\n  important diplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the\\n  United States and its nationals.  Iran\\'s policy behavior\\n  presents challenges to the national security and foreign\\n  policy of the United States.  The IACRs issued pursuant to\\n  Executive Order No. 12170 continue to play an important role\\n  in structuring our relationship with Iran and in enabling\\n  the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords.\\n  Similarly, the ITRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12613\\n  continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter-\\n  national terrorism.

I can only point up its\\nlogical implications, and say that they seem to contradict the usage\\nof the word \"objective\" in other areas.  Indeed, by your definition, an\\nobjective x is an oxymoron, for all x.  I have no quibble with that\\nbelief, other than that it is useless, and that \"objective\" is a perfectly\\ngood word.\\n\\n#> So, what *is* objective?  Not the age of the universe, anyway, as I show\\n#> above.\\n#\\n#      How many ages can the universe have, and still be internally self-\\n#consistent? I\\'d be amazed if it was more than one. How many different\\n#moral systems can different members of society have - indeed, single\\n#individuals, in some cases - and humanity still stick together?\\n\\nBegging the question.  People can have many opinions about the age\\nof the universe and humanity can still stick together.   You are\\nsaying that the universe has a _real_ age, independent of my beliefs about\\nit.  Why?\\n\\n#      The age of the universe, like most scientific facts, can be\\n#emirically verified through means that\\'ll give the same result no matter\\n#who performs the testing (albeit there are error bars that may be on the\\n#largish side...). \\n\\nThis assumes that the universe has a real age, or any kind of reality\\nwhich doesn\\'t depend on what we think.   Why should an extreme Biblical\\nCreationist give a rat\\'s ass about the means of which you speak?\\n\\n#I\\'ve heard of no way to verify morality in a\\n#consistent way, much less compute the errors of the measurement; care to\\n#enlighten me?\\n\\nThe same is true of pain, but painkillers exist, and can be predicted\\nto work with some accuracy better than a random guess.  I wrote\\nelsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value.\\nIf a moral system makes a prediction \"It will be better if...\",\\nthat can be tested, and is falsifiable in the same way as a prediction\\n\"This drug will relieve pain...\"\\n\\n#      People\\'s *ideas* about the age of object X are *not* objective;\\n#you can have any idea you like, and I can\\'t stop you.

For this reason, the war-criminals\\ncall all the Bosnian Muslims \"Turks\" even though they are not ethnically\\nTurk and do not speak Turkish as their first language.  For this reason,\\nwhat is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically\\nidentical but religiously \"other\" is called, paradoxically, \"ethnic\\ncleansing\" rather than \"religious cleansing.\"\\n\\nThus, while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of\\nWWII, and older agenda, the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from\\nBosnian, is being carried out under the cover of the Serbo-Croat war.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nMike.',\n",

It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs\\nas Ermeniyye.\\n \\nOthers believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as \\'Harminap\\'\\nwhich was later modified by the Persians to \\'Arminia\\'. \\'Ar\\' refers to a\\nplace, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror, \\nwhile \\'men\\' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and \\ntherefore \\'Armen\\' would appear to signify \\'the people of that place\\'.\\n\\nG. Alishan believes that \\'according to our national vocabulary \"Haik\"\\nis the diminutive form of \"Hai\", and that \"Hai\" is the name of our\\nnation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word \"Armen\" that\\nforeigners apply to our people.\\'\\n\\nIt would thus appear that \\'Armenia\\' is a place-name, that \\'Armen\\' is \\nthe name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way\\nconnected with the word \\'Hai\\'.\\n\\nHaik and Haiastan:\\n\\nArmenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom\\nthe Armenian people took the name \\'Hai\\'. But the mere resemblance\\nbetween the words \\'Haik\\' and \\'Hai\\' constitutes no real proof, and,\\nin any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of\\nKhoren.\\n\\nHaiasa:\\n\\nThe following studies show quite clearly that \\'Hai\\' and \\'Haiasa\\' were\\nno more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the \\nregion known as Armenia.\\n\\nProfessor Hachadurian: \\'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite\\ninscriptions for Upper Armenia.\\'\\n\\nYensen, in his \\'Hittites and Armenians\\' tries to prove that \\'Hai\\' is\\nidentical with the Hittite \\'Hatio\\', in other words that \\'Hai\\' is a\\nHittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown\\nthat \\'Hai\\' was derived from \\'Hatio\\'.\\n\\nMortman\\'s attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with \\nno success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.\\n\\nThe resemblance between the words \\'Haiasa\\' and \\'Haiastan\\' is so obvious\\nthat we may well accept \\'Haiasa\\' as the oldest form of \\'Haiastan\\'.\\n\\nLet us now cast a brief glance on how the words \\'Hai\\', \\'Haikazan\\' and\\n\\'Haiastan\\' entered our older works.\\n\\nAccording to Karakashian: \\n\\n\\'The word \"Haik\" is never to be found employed with reference to a\\nleader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it\\never found employed in the forms \"Haika\" or \"Haykazn\".\\n\\nAgahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he\\nimproved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred\\nto a nation and had been derived from \"Hai\" or \"Haik\" they could \\nalso have used the words \"Haikak\" and \"Haykazn\" in a number of\\nplaces.\\'\\n\\nAccording to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite \\ninscriptions:\\n\\n\\'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality\\nor species. The words \"Haddanas\", \"Haddina\" were used by the \\nAssyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the\\n\"d\" between the two \"a\" letters to \"y\" \"Hadinasdani\" was in this\\nway transformed to \"Haiastan\"\\'.\\n\\nProfessor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards\\nthe significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms \\'Hai\\'\\nand \\'Haistan\\' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a \\nsolution to this problem is brought nearer by the name \\'Haiasa\\' \\nwhich is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards.\\nForrer takes \\'Haiasa\\' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case\\nit seems likely that \\'Haiasa\\' was actually a part of Armenia. The\\nsuffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is \\'Hayasa\\', which\\nrefers to the country of the \\'Hayasas\\'.\\n\\nE. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological \\nand Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.\\n\\nThe Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost\\nall of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark,\\nabove average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties\\nwith certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.\\n\\nAccording to J. Deniker:\\n\\nFrom the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be\\nregarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are \\ndescended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their\\naverage height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region.\\nThey are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of \\n85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic\\nfamily.\\n\\nProfessor Rene Vernont writes as follows:\\n\\nThe Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols,\\nbut some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a little\\nabove average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often\\na hooked nose and a rather wide mouth. \\n\\nInvestigations carried out by N.

The \\'Pomaks\\' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \\nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \\nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \\naccording to the agreements? \\n\\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \\nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \\nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\\nin 1980 the \\'democratic\\' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \\ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\\n\\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \\nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \\nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \\nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the \\'so-called\\' \\nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \\nof historical monuments. \\n\\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \\nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \\nHellenizing the region.\\n\\nThe longstanding use of the adjective \\'Turkish\\' in titles\\nand on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts have\\nordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers\\' Association, \\nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \\nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \\nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\\nthe word \\'Turkish\\' on their buildings and on their official\\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \\nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\\n\\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \\nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \\nfindings were published in a report titled \\n\\n \\'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.\\'\\n\\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \\nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \\nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \\nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \\nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \\nLausanne Convention. \\n\\n\\nHELSINKI WATCH: \"PROBLEMS OF TURKS IN WESTERN THRACE CONTINUE\"\\n\\nAnkara (A.A)  In a 15-page report  of the \"Helsinki Watch\"  it is\\nstated that the Turkish minority in Western Thrace is still faced\\nwith problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being\\nimplemented by the Greek Government be brought to an end.\\n\\nThe report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government\\nshould grant  social and political  rights to all the  members of\\nminorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens and\\nin addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the \"Turkish\\nMinority\" in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identify\\nthemselves as \\'Turks\\'.\\n\\nNEWSPOT, May 1992\\n\\n\\nGREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS\\n\\nThe  Xanthi independent  MP Ahmet  Faikoglu said  that the  Greek\\nstate is trying to cut all  contacts and relations of the Turkish\\nminority with Turkey.\\n\\nPointing out that while the  Greek minority living in Istanbul is\\ncalled \"Greek\"  by ethnic  definition, only  the religion  of the\\nminority in  Western Thrace is  considered. In an  interview with\\nTurkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in Western\\nTrace are also Turkish.\"\\n\\nEmphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority in\\nWestern  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreement\\nsigned in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey\\nin Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace.\\n\\nRecalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr.\\nSadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority,\\nFaikoglu said.  \"In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we prevented\\nGreece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European\\ncountries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal\\nrights.\"\\n\\nOn Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are\\npredestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical\\nreasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign\\npowers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by\\ncooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was\\nwill to improve relations with Greece.\\n\\nNEWSPOT, January 1993\\n\\n\\nMACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.\\n\\nTwo ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in\\nAthens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a\\nCourt Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.\\n\\n  Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis)\\nhave been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in\\nan Athenian magazine.\\n\\n  Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly\\nmagazine  \"ENA\"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as\\nMacedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would\\nfield  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek\\ngeneral election.\\n\\n  Bulev said in the interview: \"I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.\"\\nSideropoulos said  in the  article that \"Greece  should recognise\\nMacedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations\\nagainst  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the\\nborder, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC\\nare falling.\"\\n\\n  The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court\\nsummons,  was   that  \"they  have   spread...intentionally  false\\ninformation  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the\\ncitizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the\\ninternational interests of the country (Greece).\"\\n\\n  The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a\\nMacedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to\\n1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely\\nconcentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state\\nif anyone declares themselves Macedonian.\\n\\n  In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned\\nMacedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian\\nvillages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in\\n1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5\\nmillion Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000\\nin Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.\\n\\n  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian\\nhuman rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a\\nfew years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in\\nthe mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced\\nthe Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of\\nFlorina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the\\nmajority of ethnic Macedonians live.\\n\\n  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in\\nwhich  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent,\\nespecially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its\\nnorthern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.\\n\\n  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned\\nGreece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who\\nlargely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the\\nUS government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections\\nare over.\\n\\n================================================================\\n                M.

       " '\\n\\nDiplomatic :-)\\n\\nI realize I\\'m fighting Occam\\'s razor in this argument, so I\\'ll try to\\nexplain why I feel a mind is necessary. \\n\\nFirstly, I\\'m not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They\\'re\\ngreat at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not\\nat working out the method itself.\\n\\nAs a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the\\nsimple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do\\nthese with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks.\\nNow, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but\\nin doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program\\nthem into the computer. You can, of course, \\'obfuscate\\' the trick, and\\nwrite the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see,\\nthe trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does\\nthis mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already\\npre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that\\nour brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic\\nmaterial, much of which isn\\'t used.\\n\\nOne way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but\\n(again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of \\'if you see\\nobject X, then perform action Y,\\' and we don\\'t seem to get anywhere.\\nThe algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what\\nconclusions to draw from it\\'s experience.\\n\\nThe other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many\\nalgorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet\\npeople survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are\\nside-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also,\\nneurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -\\ncan an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it\\'s\\ncode?\\n\\nThe next problem is the sticky question of \"What is colour?\" (replace\\n\\'colour\\' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the\\nmaterialist viewpoint is that it\\'s the product of some kind of\\nchemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\\ndifferent chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a\\ncomputer won\\'t see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an\\nalgorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an\\nequivalent that doesn\\'t? It shouldn\\'t, because the outputs of each\\nalgorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do\\nwe see colour?\\n\\n\\n\\nA bit of idle speculation...\\n\\nIf I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\\nwith two processes acting on it. The first process has been called\\n\\'Unitary Evolution\\' (or \\'U\\'), is governed by Schroedinger\\'s equation\\nand is well known. The second process, called various things such as\\n\\'collapse of the wavefunction\\' or \\'state vector reduction\\' (or \\'R\\'),\\nand is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a\\n\\'measurement\\' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely\\nwhen that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly\\nchange the wavefunction.\\n\\nI envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and \\'something\\nelse,\\' which I shall imaginitively call \\'part X.\\' It seems reasonable\\nto assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be\\nthe wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the\\nwavefunction. Note, though, that we\\'d need more than U to explain R.)\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to\\nbe some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear\\nsuperpositions of anything, although there are alternative\\nexplainations for this. I\\'ve no idea how a brain is supposed to access\\npart X, but since this is only speculation, that won\\'t matter too\\nmuch :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in\\nphysics.\\n\\nI\\'ll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that\\'s OK with you :-)\\n\\n\\n-- \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nKevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk\\n            Don\\'t believe anything you read in .sig files.',\n",

During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian\\n was permitted to approach the city and its environs.\\n\\n While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained\\n in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the\\n area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to \\n attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the\\n plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder\\n of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by\\n the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers\\n who had remained in the rear during the war.\\n\\n One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of\\n soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of\\n seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,\\n and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud\\n and dirt...\\n\\n It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and\\n traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds\\n and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night\\n patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The \\n Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear\\n also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the\\n trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for\\n fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder\\n and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.\\n\\n Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir\\n Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander\\n in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.\\n The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals\\n that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its\\n highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half\\n of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.\\n\\n ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,\\n Odishelidge. They were as follows:\\n\\n The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the\\n act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...\\n More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been\\n killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless \\n Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the\\n murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood \\n near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:\\n \\'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.\\' Thus ten\\n more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when\\n the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.\\n\\n The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently\\n fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.\\n Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw\\n towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew\\n to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and\\n destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.\\n\\n During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages\\n that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the \\n Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers\\n were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time\\n when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill\\n the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries\\n of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the \\n Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would\\n have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from\\n acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with\\n hatred and loathing.\\n\\n Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that\\n he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The\\n Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the\\n stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since\\n the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed\\n in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen\\n of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping\\n him with the iron heel of his boot.\\n\\n Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape\\n from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off\\n by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered\\n children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village\\n of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:\\n\\n There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.\\n Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and\\n spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about\\n 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 \\n centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,\\n children and old people. The women\\'s bodies had obvious marks of\\n rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.\\n\\n A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators\\n for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov\\n to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be \\n proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel\\'s\\n disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,\\n instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely\\n reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told\\n the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more\\n licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent\\n and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity\\n and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,\\n the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and\\n claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.\\n\\n An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command\\n narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:\\n\\n The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut\\n out the women\\'s heart and placed the heart on top of her head.\\n The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men \\n of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they\\n took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people\\n among this group were able to save their lives as the result of\\n my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were \\n released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. \\n Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the\\n Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered\\n on the streets.\\n\\n On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent\\n Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were\\n threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for\\n murdering an innocent Turk. \\n\\n When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would \\n be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: \\'How dare\\n you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?\\' In Erzurum, the \\n Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard\\n that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within\\n the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same \\n day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to\\n him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible\\n act. However no result was achieved.\\n\\n In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a\\n natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived\\n the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the \\n Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had\\n been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. \\n The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed\\n one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached\\n three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details\\n of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers\\n were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even\\n withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred\\n people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading\\n Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.\\n However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with\\n the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower\\n classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders\\n of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. \\n\\n I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals\\n were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who\\n opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that\\n it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.\\n Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian\\n cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have\\n supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred\\n to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by\\n the Russians of infamy, would say the following: \\'You are Russians.\\n You can never understand the Armenian cause.\\' The Armenians had a\\n conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear\\n of the Turkish soldiers.\\n\\n The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real\\n nature of the Armenian ideology. Nothing which is already done can\\n be undone.\"\\n\\nSerdar Argic',\n",

If the Lebanese army can control these \\nelements then I think we can see genuine peace on the Israel-Lebanese border.\\nI remind you that a couple thousand Lebanese cross each day into Israel to \\nwork.\\nAs for the election of Bashir Gemayel, it is true that he was favorable to\\nIsrael, is that why the Syrians killed him?

       " 'While this is essentially a discussion of reincarnation in the context of\\nChristianity Gerry Palo has made some comparisons to Asian religious\\nbeliefs on this topic which have simplified the Asian idea of karma\\nto the point of misrepresentation.\\n\\nThere are significant differences in the idea of karma among Hindus,\\nJains, Buddhists (and even among the various Buddhist traditions.)\\n\\nTo refer to karma as a system of reward for past deeds is totally\\nincorrect in the Buddhist and Jain traditions.  Karma is considered to\\nbe a moral process in which intentions (either good or evil) shape\\na person\\'s predilections for future intention and action and\\nproduce a person who is more prone to good than evil, or the opposite --\\n\"reward\" has nothing to do with it.  Both Jainism and Buddhism are atheistic\\nso there is no deity to dispense rewards or punishments.  Karma is usually\\ndescribed in terms of seeds and reaping the fruit thereof.  In fact \"As you\\nsow, so shall you reap\" is found in the Pali Canon as I recall, the metaphor\\nof natural growth is explicit.\\n\\nHinduism, or some sects in that tradition, are I believe much more\\ndeterministic and involve concepts closer to reward and punishment being\\ntheistically inclined.\\n\\nIn point of fact, the Theravadin Buddhist tradition of Southeast Asia\\nconsiders karma as only one of five influences in human life, and in\\nfact from their point of view they would be unable to explain the mechanics\\nof karma without the element of free will.\\n\\nAlso in Eastern religions there is a difference between reincarnation and\\nrebirth, which is essentially absent in Western considerations.\\n\\nIsn\\'t Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation\\namong Christian thinkers?

Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning\\nof arsenokoitai.  He takes the term in I Cor 6:9 as denoting males who actively\\nengage in homosexual acts, in contrast to malakoi (\"effeminate\"), those who\\nengage passively in such acts.*4   However, he insists that Paul knew nothing\\nof \"inversion as an inherited trait, or an inherent condition due to\\npsychological or glandular causes, and consequently regards all homosexual\\npractice as evidence of perversion\" (38).  Hence Bailey limits the term\\'s\\nreference in Paul\\'s works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the\\nterm as \"homosexuals.\"  Bailey wants to distinguish between \"the homosexual\\n*condition* (which is morally neutral) and homosexual *practices*\" [italics in\\nsource].  Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatt\\'s translation\\n\"sodomites\" best represents Paul\\'s meaning in Bailey\\'s judgment (39).  Bailey\\nclearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers.\\n\\nJ. Boswell\\n\\n     The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is\\nthat of John Boswell.*5    Whereas the usual translation*6  of this term gives\\nit either explicitly or implicitly an active sense, Boswell gives it a passive\\nsense.\\n\\n      In an extended discussion of the term (341-53), he cites \"linguistic\\nevidence and common sense\" to support his conclusion that the word means \"male\\nsexual agents, i.e. active male prostitutes.\"  His argument is that the arseno-\\npart of the word is adjectival, not the object of the koitai which refers to\\nbase sexual activity.  Hence the term, according to Boswell, designates a male\\nsexual person or male prostitute.  He acknowledges, however, that most\\ninterpret the composite term as active, meaning \"those who sleep with, make\\ntheir bed with, men.\"  Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the\\nhistorical setting.  He argues that in some compounds, such as paidomathes\\n(\"child learner\"), the paido- is the subject of manthano, and in others, such\\nas paidoporos (\"through which a child passes\"), the paido- is neither subject\\nnor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance.  His point is\\nthat each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning.  More\\ndirectly, he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno- employ it\\nobjectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective\\n(343).  Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno-.\\n\\n     Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time, namely drauci or exoleti. \\nThese were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects.  The Greek\\narsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci;  the corresponding passive\\nwould be parakoitai (\"one who lies beside\"), Boswell affirms.  He claims that\\narsenokoitai was the \"most explicit word available to Paul for a male\\nprostitute,\" since by Paul\\'s time the Attic words pornos (\"fornicator\") and\\nporneuon (\"one committing fornication\"), found also in the LXX, had been\\nadopted \"to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed\\nfornication.\"*7\\n\\n     In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus, Plato,\\nAristotle, and Plutarch, and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus,\\nBoswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that\\narsenokoitai \"did not connote \\'homosexual\\' or even \\'sodomite\\' in the time of\\nPaul\" (346).*8   He also demonstrates its absence in Pseudo-Lucian, Sextus\\nEmpiricus, and Libanius.  He subsequently finds it lacking in \"all discussions\\nof homosexual relation\" (346)*9  among Christian sources in Greek, including\\nthe Didache, Tatian, Justin Martyr, Eusebius,*10    Clement of Alexandria,\\nGregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom.  Chrysostom is singled out for his\\nomission as \"final proof\" that the word could not mean homosexuality.*11 \\n\\n     Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim from\\ndiscussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers (348).*12   Cited are\\nTertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius, and Augustine.  The last named uses\\n\"circumlocutions.\"  Other Latin writers include Ausonius, Cyprian, and Minucius\\nFelix.  The term is also lacking in state and in church legislation.  By the\\nsixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual\\nactivities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife\\n(353).\\n\\n     Having surveyed the sources, Boswell concludes, \\n\\n   There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted\\n   homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter, and every\\nreason\\n   to suppose that, whatever they came to mean, they were not determinative of\\n   Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353).\\n\\nIt is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male\\nprostitutes.  He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably not\\ndisapprove of \"gay inclination,\"  \"gay relationships,\"  \"enduring love between\\npersons of the same gender,\" or \"same-sex eroticism\"  (112, 166-17).\\n\\n\\n________________________________________________________\\n4.  D.S. Bailey,  Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition. (London:\\n1975) 38.\\n5.  J.  Boswell, Christianity,  Social Tolerance and Homosexuality (Chicago:\\n1980).\\n6.  Several tranlation of I Tim 1:10 are:  KJV, \"them that defile themselves\\nwith mankind\";  ASV,  \"Abusers of themselves with men\";  NASB,  \"homosexuals\";\\nRSV, NKJV, NRSV, \"sodomites\";  NEB, NIV, \"perverts\"; GNB, \"sexual perverts\"; In\\nI COr 6:9 these occur:  KJV, \"abusers of themselves with mankind\"; ASV,\\n\"Abusers of themselves with men\";  NASB, RSV, \"homosexuals\"; NKJV, \"sodomites\";\\n NEB, \"homosexual persversion.\"  The RSV and NEB derive their translation from\\ntwo Greek words, malakoi and arsenokoitai which GBN has as \"homosexual\\nperverts.\"  NRSV has the two words as \"male prostitutes\" in the text, and\\n\"sodomites\" in the footnote.  The active idea predominates among the\\ncommentators as well;  it is the primary assumption.\\n7.  Boswell, Christianity 344.  Yet this was no a word \"available to Paul for a\\nmale prostitute,\" for it does not occur at all in any literature prior to Paul\\n(as a serach in the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae using IBYCUC confirms).  If Paul\\ncoined the term, it would have no prior history, and all such discussion about\\nits lack of usage in contemporary non-Christian and Christian literature is\\nmeaningless.\\n8.

Yet Eusebius uses it in \"Demonstraionis evangelicae 1.\"\\n11.  Either Boswell is misrepresenting the facts about Chrysostom\\'s use of\\narsenokoitai and its form (about 20) in the vice lists of I Cor 6 or I Tim 1,\\nor he is begging the question by denying that the word can mean homosexual when\\nChrysostom uses it.  Yet the meaning of arsenokoitai is the goal of his and our\\nstudy, whether in the lists or other discussions.  Boswell later admits (351)\\nthat Chrysostom uses the almost identicl form arsenokoitos in his commentary on\\nI Cor.  Although Boswell suggests that the passage is strange, it may be that\\nPaul is seeking to make a refinement in arsenokoitai.  \\n12.  Apparently Jerome is a significant omission here, since he renders\\narsenokoitai as \"masculorum concubitores,\" corresponding \"almost exactly to the\\nGreek\" (348 n.36).\\n\\nfootnotes:\\n_______________________\\n 5.

I had a girl, and I, without\\nIgor, named her Raisa, in honor of her dead grandmother.\\n\\nOur family and the Melkumians had been neighbors since 1965. Igor and I grew \\nup together, we were friends from childhood on. We got engaged when I was 16. \\nIn 1981, when I was 18, we were married. Two children were born to us in \\nSumgait. My daughter is now 6 years old, her name is Kristina, and my son,\\nSeryozha, is four and a half.\\n\\nFirst I shall tell what happened on February 27. That day on my way home from \\nwork I passed Lenin Square, where about 1,500 people had gathered. There were \\nKomsomol members there, and Pioneers [Children\\'s organization], and there were \\nboth Party members and non-Party people there as well. All of them were \\nshouting, \"There\\'s no room for Christians here!\" and \"When we finish with the \\nArmenians, we\\'ll go after the Russians!\" And some even cried Out, \"Death to \\nthe Armenians!\" Absurd rumors had been circulating about town. I became \\nfrightened. I came home, breathless, and told about everything I had seen \\ndowntown. My family couldn\\'t believe it. My father-in-law Sogomon Markovich \\nMelkumian, wasn\\'t home, he was at an Azerbaijani wedding. By eight o\\'clock he \\nreturned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was \\nsmashed with a rock. He got out of the car but there was no one there. Well I \\nwas telling him everything, too, and he said, \"What, is there no longer any\\ngovernment?\" That same day Igor said, \"Papa, something terrible is happening \\nin the city.\" And he said, \"We\\'ll stay at home, no one will drive us from our \\nown home.\"\\n\\nThe day passed. On February 28, that was Sunday, we didn\\'t go out. We called \\nour relatives and asked them all kinds of questions, and they all said the \\nsame thing. Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an \\nArmenian from the neighboring building. Ira, my brother-in-law\\'s wife, and I \\ncalled the police: they\\'re wrecking a car, help. We called and called, and \\nnonetheless they didn\\'t come and they didn\\'t do anything.\\n\\nOn February 29, on Monday, even though there were troops in the city, we were \\nafraid to go to work. I called the school: I had the keys to the classroom. I \\ntold the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys, I wouldn\\'t \\nbe coming in. He agreed, and even said, \"Fine, don\\'t come in, we understand \\nwhat\\'s going on in town, don\\'t come in.\"\\n\\nBefore that, on the 28th, the Ambartsumian family came over. They came to my \\nfather-in-law and said, \"Uncle Sergey, they broke our windows, bad things are \\nhappening in town.\" Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said, \"With my own eyes I \\nsaw them chasing naked girls through the streets. I don\\'t know,\" he said, \"we \\nshould leave town.\" Well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we \\nshould go, thinking we\\'d go to our dacha. We got a couple of bags together, \\nclothes, food, the bare essentials. And then somewhere around 4:45 the \\nbuilding manager came by and said, \"Uncle Sergey, the situation in town is \\nbad, don\\'t go out.\" My father even opened up to him and said, \"Maybe we\\'ll \\ndrive to the dacha, it\\'ll be safer there.\" \"No,\" he said, \"it\\'ll be worse \\nthere, you\\'ll be safer at home.\" He said don\\'t be afraid, if something happens \\nI\\'ll send people to save you.\\n\\nAfter he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our \\ncourtyard. All of us were at home at the time: Igor and I and our two \\nchildren, Ira and Edik and their daughter, my sister-in-law Ira, and my \\nmother-and father-in-law. And the Ambartsumian family, there were three of \\nthem, Uncle Misha, Zhasmen, and their daughter Marina. Now when they started\\nbreaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us, \"Go in that room\\nand close the door. Close the door and calm the children so they won\\'t hear\\nthat there\\'s anyone home.\" The children started crying. Suddenly Ira, my \\nbrother-in-law\\'s wife, suggested, \"Let\\'s run out onto the balcony.\" We -- the\\ntwo daughters-in-law and the children, and Zhasmen and Marina -- raced out\\nonto the balcony. My sister-in-law and my mother-in-law ran in and said, \\n\"Quick, over to the other balcony, or they\\'ll kill you all.\" We lived on the\\nsecond floor. We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor\\'s. At\\nfirst we couldn\\'t manage it. The balcony looked onto the street. At that time\\npeople were coming home from work, and many just stood there, watching. I \\npleaded and begged: \"Please, call someone, have someone come!\" I even started \\nshouting. \"I\\'ll throw down the children, I\\'ll throw them down, you catch them \\nand take them somewhere, so at least the children will survive.\" Either they \\nwere afraid or . . . I don\\'t know what. They looked as though they were \\nwatching a movie. Some of them started throwing stones at us. I\\'ll say it \\nagain, these weren\\'t the bandits, these were people from the other part of the \\nbuilding and from our entryway, they were just regular people, passersby. A \\nbus even stopped. I remember a man\\'s voice saying the Armenians were climbing\\nover to the other balcony. Ira, my sister-in-law, helped us get the children \\nover there. I was pregnant, about seven months pregnant. No, it wasn\\'t yet \\nseven, it was six and a half. I climbed over too. I think Zhasmen went first; \\nyou know, I just don\\'t remember it all that well. Zhasmen went first, I think, \\nand Edik\\'s wife Ira and I had the children, and they were all screaming and \\ncrying. My Kristina said, \"Mamma, don\\'t throw us over the balcony, we\\'re \\nafraid!\" Lilia was crying, and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too. Kristina \\ndidn\\'t even want to climb over. She shouted, \"I\\'m staying with Grandmother,\\nI\\'m staying with Grandma!\" She loved her grandma, more than she loved me. And \\nmy mother-in-law shouted, \"Oh no, Kristina\\'s still there, she\\'s still there, \\nsave Kristina, too!\" Ira helped us climb over, with Kristina coming last. Ira \\nhelped us and went back inside.\\n\\nWe started pounding on the neighbor\\'s balcony door. I pounded with my fist, \\nSevil, open the door, open it, please!\" She didn\\'t open it. \"No, go away, go \\nanywhere, go, I\\'m not opening the door.\" She was our neighbor, we were \\nfriends, we never refused her anything, ever! And apparently she thought we \\nwere going to break the windows, and she opened the door. She opened it and \\nsaid, \"Karina, Karina, go away, go anywhere, just don\\'t stay here, they\\'ll \\nkill us, too, because of you.\" I begged, \"Please, at least take the children, \\nwe\\'ll leave, we\\'ll go back.\" \"No,\" she said, \"you have to leave.\" Her sons ran \\nin, one had a knife. Sevil\\'s brother, he\\'s around 18, shouted at us: \"Get out \\nof here, leave, I\\'ll kill you with this knife!\" I became terrified, I took the \\nchildren and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs. I went down \\nand heard a loudspeaker. It was in the courtyard \"The Armenians must be \\nkilled, they\\'ve taken all the best places, all the best apartments!\" One of \\nthem said, \"Let the Armenian blood flow, none of them should survive!\" When I \\nheard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors. No one opened their \\ndoor for me! Not on the third floor, or the fourth. I couldn\\'t see Zhasmen any \\nlonger. Ira came upstairs later. I even thought that they had let her stay, \\nthat they would save her.\\n\\nMy head was spinning. They were killing my family, and here I was in the next \\nentryway with two children. Seryozha was four, and Kristina was five and a \\nhalf. They were crying, \"Mamma, we\\'re scared!\" They were so frightened that I \\ndidn\\'t even know how to calm them, should I try to calm them or myself? It was \\nawful. But on the third floor a man did open his door. I asked, \"Open up, let \\nme inside!\" He opened the door slightly and said, \"No!\" \"No\" and that was it! \\nHe said it so sternly: \"No!\" I went up to the fifth floor. I pounded my fists \\non the door with all my might. He opened up, the man of the house, and stood \\nthere, looking at me. I was ready to get down on my knees. I almost did get \\ndown on my knees. \"Please, I beg of you, at least take the children.\" He \\nwasn\\'t an Azerbaijani, he was a Lezgin. I don\\'t even know how, but he let me \\ninside. And when I went in, Zhasmen was already there. Two minutes hadn\\'t \\npassed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs. Lilia was crying. He didn\\'t want \\nto open the door. And again I started pleading, \"Please, open the door, it\\'s \\nour Ira and Lilia! Open the door!\" And he said, \"No, I\\'m afraid.\" I said again \\nand again, \"Please, open the door, please!\" He looked at me. He looked at me \\nfor a long time and then opened the door after all. Ira came in with Lilia. We \\nthrew ourselves into each other\\'s arms, crying. Then the man locked us into \\nthe bathroom. We sat there for a long time. Through the door he told us, \"Calm \\nthe children, and calm yourselves down, too.\"\\n\\nCalm down? This man was hiding us, but what of our family? When I was still in \\nour apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive. I \\nsaid, \"Igor, Edik, let\\'s say farewell.\" And Edik turned around and looked at \\nme as if to say, is that some kind of joke? All the same I thought they would \\nkill all of us. Igor looked at me, too . . . But it was already too late! They \\nstarted pounding on the door, Igor was standing next to the door. Before that \\nhe had told us, \"Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight.\" He thought we \\nwere in the room. But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them: \\n\"Edik, Igor, let\\'s say farewell.\" Igor didn\\'t think we could climb over to the \\nother balcony. And we did get over there, and I myself can\\'t believe we were \\nable to save ourselves.\\n\\nIgor put on a helmet, and Edik had his coat on, and he put on a fur hat. All \\nthe men--Igor, Edik, their father, and Misha Ambartsumian--they all stood next \\nto the door. They thought they would pound on it a while and leave. But from \\nthe other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani: \"Open the door!\" We \\nwere all silent, waiting. Someone outside the door said, \"They\\'re home,\\nthey\\'re in there, break down the door!\" And I remember my father-in-law \\nwhispering, \"They\\'re going to break it down now, it\\'s coming down now . . . \"\\n\\nHe had something in his hands, I think it was a knife: if they got in, we were \\ngoing to defend ourselves. In the hall near the door there were two metal \\nchair legs. From outside the door they said, \"We\\'re counting to five, open \\nup!\" But we were all quiet, we didn\\'t answer them. We made like no one was \\nhome. We figured they\\'d leave, they\\'d get tired and leave. My father-in-law \\nhad said, \"It\\'s not possible they\\'d come into my home. How can that be? \\nEveryone knows us, all of Sumgait knows our family, we are on good terms with \\neveryone.\" And indeed a day did not pass that there wasn\\'t an Azerbaijani \\nguest at our table. We had a nice dacha, everyone would get together there \\noften, Azerbaijanis liked being with us there too. But now we had to save \\nourselves, we had to flee from our own home. Ira, I remember, said, \"I\\'m not \\nleaving here, my brothers and my parents are here, I\\'m going to fight \\nalongside them.\" That\\'s just what she said. She picked up a knife and said, \\n\"If they open the door and come into the apartment then I\\'m going to fight \\nalongside my family, I\\'m not going anywhere.\"\\n\\nWe were at Sevil\\'s when they broke into our apartment. We heard fighting and \\nshouting. The noise was terrible. And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor \\nat the Lezgin\\'s apartment, you could hear everything up there, too. Even Ira\\'s \\nvoice. I remember her calling her mother several times. She called her for a \\nlong time . . . I started pounding on the door in the bathroom: \"Open the \\ndoor, what are they doing to Ira, who\\'s shouting, that\\'s Ira shouting, that\\'s \\nher voice!\" But the Lezgin said, \"It\\'s nothing, calm down, no, it\\'s not in \\nyour apartment.\" He was lying to me so I\\'d calm down. Two hours went by and \\nthe Lezgin opened the door and said, \"Karina, Igor got away, calm down. He ran \\naway.\" He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes. They killed him \\noutside, next to the building.\\n\\nWhile we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human terror. The \\nway Ira shouted! She shouted, \"Save me, Mamma, save me! . . . Mamma, Mamma!\" \\nShe repeated it several times. There was a wild din. There were very many \\npeople there, all of them shouting, all of them bellowing, howling, \\nwhistling--you just can\\'t imagine what was going on, what the roar was like.\\n\\nApparently, after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway \\nwhere we were hiding and came upstairs, all the way up to the fifth floor. I \\ndon\\'t know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us in\\nparticular, but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed \\nover the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters-in-law \\nwere climbing over the balconies. And after we heard Ira we heard them coming \\nup the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors. I thought those were \\nour last moments, and started saying good-bye to my children, kissing them. \\nThey were sleeping. I woke them up: \"Kristina! Seryozha, wake up!\" And I tell \\nIra: \"Ira, if something happens, we\\'ll throw ourselves off the balcony.\" We \\nwere on the fifth floor. Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door \\ntoo, because later he said, \"I opened the door and told them there were no \\nArmenians inside.\" And after they all left our neighbor went out on the \\nbalcony himself to see: they were gone.\\n\\nWe weren\\'t friends with those Lezgin neighbors, we only knew each other from \\nthe building. But the people we were friends with wouldn\\'t even consider \\nhiding us.\\n\\nThe Lezgin let us out of the bathroom. They had a candle burning. He said, \\n\"Karina, there\\'re no lights on in our block.\" The whole block was dark, the \\nwhole block! It\\'s a huge block, too. The Lezgin said, \"I\\'m afraid to keep\\nyou until morning, I\\'m afraid of the neighbors, they might kill me for saving\\nyou.\" I said, \"What are you saying, we\\'ll leave now. But we can\\'t just leave\\nwith the children in the middle of the night. Give us time to find somewhere\\nelse to hide.\" He said, \"Well OK, go look.\" I asked Ira, \"Ira, do you want to\\ngo?\" Ira said, \"No, I\\'ll stay with the children, Karina.\" I said, \"Fine, then\\nI\\'ll go.\" Zhasmen and I went downstairs together. It was very dark. No one \\nwas in the courtyard. It was dark, pitch black. l was afraid to go out at \\nafter seven, Igor always met me after work and accompanied me home, I never \\nwent out alone. And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after a\\nslaughter like that, too. It was probably after eleven. Later I called the \\nboarding school and my director answered. He said, \"Karina, where are you?\" I\\ndidn\\'t know, I was calling from a public phone outside and didn\\'t know where I \\nwas. I got confused and hung up the receiver. From him I only found out what \\ntime it was, I asked him, \"What time is it?\" He said 11:20, I think, but I \\ndon\\'t really remember. So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the courtyard. I \\nlook and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment. And there\\nwas the smell of something burnt. I became horrified. I looked at the corpse \\nfor a long time. It was either Ira or Edik. I only saw one of them, Zhasmen \\ngrabbed my hand and squeezed it: \"Hurry up, let\\'s go . . . Hurry up, come on, \\nwhat are you turning around for?\" I turned around and saw a large truck, it \\nmust have belonged to the bandits, because they came to kill us in a truck \\nlike that. We lived in the third entryway, and that truck was next to the \\nfourth. We walked quickly, holding hands. I thought, if I go to the police \\nthen they\\'ll put me away. I couldn\\'t count on them. Before I reached the \\npolice station I saw a military vehicle. We went over and I said, \"Soldier, in \\nBlock 41, I don\\'t know if they\\'ve killed people or injured them--we need to \\nsave them!\" And he said, \"Go to the police station and tell them everything.\" \\nI said, \"I\\'m afraid to go there, I\\'m afraid of them.\" He said, \"Don\\'t be \\nafraid.\"\\n\\nWe went to the police and they wrote down the address, and the military \\nvehicle went to our building. I didn\\'t go with them, they left me at the \\npolice station. I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that \\nthey\\'d rescue them, too. I didn\\'t know where they were or what had happened to\\nthem.\\n\\nAfter a while they brought my children and Ira and Lilia. First they took us \\nto the KGB, that was at two or three in the morning. Then around five they \\ntook us to the City Party Committee, and there were very many people there, \\nvery many. I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress. Seryozha was \\nonly wearing a shirt, and Kristina had a little dress on. No coat, no boots, \\nnothing! And we sat there for three whole days in the City Party Committee.\\n\\nThe Lezgin had told me that Igor escaped. And I thought that he was probably \\nalive. But then after two and a half days, they took us, the Armenians of \\nSumgait, to Nasosny. On March 6 some people from the Central Committee came \\nand told us, \"Karina, Ira, we need you, come with us to the City Party \\nCommittee.\" My Mamma had come to Nasosny, and she had been looking for me for \\nsix days. Mama, my brothers, and my uncle. We went to the City Party Committee \\nand waited there in the courtyard. I was wearing nothing but a dress, and Ira \\nhad only a dress on as well. There was a strong wind on March 6. An hour went \\nby. And then one of the functionaries told us, \"Karina, Ira, gather your \\ncourage. Would you like to go to the burial?\" I said, \"What, did they really \\nkill all of them?!\" He said, \"Let\\'s look.\" He had a long list, and he started \\nreading them off: Igor Melkumian, my husband, Eduard Melkumian, my brother-in-\\nlaw, Irina Melkumian, my sister-in-law, Sogomon Melkumian, my father-in-law,\\nand Raisa Melkumian, my mother-in-law. He read off all their names and said, \\n\"Get in the car, let\\'s go to the burial.\"\\n\\nWe buried our family. I couldn\\'t believe it at the time, I couldn\\'t conceive\\nof it or imagine it . . . And even now I think how shall I explain it to my \\nchildren when they\\'re older?\\n\\nMy children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and\\ngrandmother. Kristina didn\\'t love me the way she loved her grandfather and\\ngrandmother, they spoiled her. Kristina would always announce, \"My grandma is \\nbetter than anyone!\" Now, even though she is getting used to my mother, it\\'s \\ndifficult for her, and once she told her: \"You\\'re a bad grandmother.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t know why, I asked her, \"Kristina, where\\'s Papa?\" and she said, \"They \\nkilled him.\" She knows, she understands it all. And recently I scolded\\nSeryozha severely for something, and he started shouting at me, \"When Papa \\ncomes I\\'m going to tell him everything!\"\\n\\nJuly 26, 1988\\nNairi Boarding House\\nNear the Village of Arzakan\\nHrazdan District\\nArmenian SSR\\n\\t\\t\\t- - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

(Note, this\\n#>is *any* belief, not belief in Gods)\\n#>\\n# \\n#Tiring to say the least. I have backed it up, read the first statement.\\n\\nI have read it.  Conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point.\\n\\n# \\n#The latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy. Saying someone believes\\n#something is hardly an information about the person at all. Saying someone\\n#is a theist holds much more information. Further, the correlation between\\n#theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism\\n#because of the special features of theistic belief.\\n\\nTruth by blatant assertion.  Evidence?\\n# \\n# \\n#>#>Gullibility,\\n#>#>blind obedience to authority, lack of scepticism, and so on, are all more\\n#>#>reliable indicators.

However, the rest already\\n#gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and\\n#theism. And further, the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them\\n#to switch to fanatism easily. It takes just a nifty improvement in the\\n#theology.\\n\\nTruth by blatant assertion.  \\n# \\n# \\n#>#Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.\\n#>\\n#>No shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism,\\n#>since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed\\n#>to the case you are trying to make?\\n#>\\n# \\n#Because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people\\n#causing the correlation.

So far, it is just another of your\\n#assertions.\\n\\nSo?  You can do it.\\n# \\n# \\n#>#>|>(2)  Define \"irrational belief\".  e.g., is it rational to believe that\\n#>#>|>     reason is always useful?\\n#>#>|>\\n#>#>|\\n#>#>|Irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason. The latter has\\n#>#>|been discussed for a long time with Charley Wingate. One point is that\\n#>#>|the beliefs violate reason often, and another that a process that does\\n#>#>|not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information.\\n#>#>\\n#>#>Well, there is a glaring paradox here:  an argument that reason is useful\\n#>#>based on reason would be circular, and argument not based on reason would\\n#>#>be irrational.  Which is it?\\n#>#>\\n#>#That\\'s bogus. Self reference is not circular. And since the evaluation of\\n#>#usefulness is possible within rational systems, it is allowed.\\n#>\\n#>O.K., it\\'s oval.  It\\'s still begging the question, however.  And though\\n#>that certainly is allowed, it\\'s not rational.  And you claiming to be\\n#>rational and all.\\n#>\\n# \\n#Another of your assertions. No proof, no evidence, just claims.\\n\\nHey - I learned it from you. Did I do good?\\n# \\n# \\n#>At the risk of repeating myself, and hearing \"we had that before\" [we\\n#>didn\\'t hear a _refutation_ before, so we\\'re back.   Deal with it] :\\n#>you can\\'t use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful.  Someone\\n#>who thinks reason is crap won\\'t buy it, you see.\\n#>\\n# \\n#That is unusually weak even for you. The latter implies that my proof\\n#depends on their opinion. Somehow who does not accept that there are\\n#triangles won\\'t accept Pythagoras. Wow, that\\'s an incredible insight.\\n#I don\\'t have to prove them wrong in their opinion. It is possible to\\n#show that their systems leave out useful information respectively claims\\n#unreliable or even absurd statements to be information.\\n\\nTotally circular, and totally useless.\\n# \\n#Their wish to believe makes them believe. Things are judges by their appeal,\\n#and not by their information. It makes you feel good when you believe that\\n#may be good for them, but it contains zillions of possible pitfalls. From\\n#belief despite contrary evidence to the bogus proofs they attempt.\\n\\nTruth by blatant assertion.  I\\'ve seen as many bogus proofs of the \\nnon-existence of gods as I have of their existence.\\n\\n# \\n#Rational systems, by the way, does not mean that every data has to come from\\n#logical analysis, the point is that the evaluation of the data does not\\n#contradict logic. It easily follows that such a system does not allows to\\n#evaluate if its rational in itself. Yes, it is possible to evaluate that\\n#it is rational in a system that is not rational by the fallacies of that\\n#system, but since the validity of the axioms is agreed upon, that has as\\n#little impact as the possibility of a demon ala Descartes.\\n\\nThis just doesn\\'t parse, sorry.\\n# \\n#So far it just a matter of consistency. I use ratiional arguments to show\\n#that my system is consistent or that theirs isn\\'t. The evaluation of the\\n\\nNor this.\\n#predictions does not need rationality. It does not contradict, however.\\n# \\n# \\n#>#Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics\\n#>#and mathematics are therfore circular.\\n#>\\n#>Anybody else think Godel was silly?\\n#>\\n# \\n#Stream of consciousness typing? What is that supposed to mean?\\n# \\n# \\n#>#>The first part of the second statement contains no information, because\\n#>#>you don\\'t say what \"the beliefs\" are.  If \"the beliefs\" are strong theism\\n#>#>and/or strong atheism, then your statement is not in general true.  The\\n#>#>second part of your sentence is patently false - counterexample: an\\n#>#>axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis, but is\\n#>#>assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is\\n#>#>used to obtain it.\\n#>#>\\n#>#\\n#>#I\\'ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions\\n#>#of god here.\\n#>#\\n#>#An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis, what you say here\\n#>#is a an often refuted fallacy. Have a look at the discussion of the\\n#>#axiom of choice. And further, one can evaluate axioms in larger systems\\n#>#out of which they are usually derived. \"I exist\" is derived, if you want\\n#>#it that way.\\n#>#\\n#>#Further, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.\\n#>#\\n#>#what is it you are trying to say?\\n#>\\n#>That at some point, people always wind up saying \"this datum is reliable\"\\n#>for no particular reason at all.  Example: \"I am not dreaming\".\\n#>\\n# \\n#Nope. There is evidence for it. The trick is that the choice of an axiomatic\\n#basis of a system is difficult, because the possibilities are interwoven.\\n#One therefore chooses that with the least assumptions or with assumptions\\n#that are necessary to get information out of the system anyway.\\n\\nI\\'d like to see this alleged evidence.\\n# \\n#One does not need to define axioms in order to define an evaluation method\\n#for usefulness, the foundation is laid by how one feels at all (that\\'s not\\n#how one feels about it).\\n\\nI see.  You have no irrational beliefs.  But then, fanatics never do, do\\nthey?\\n\\n# \\n#>#>|Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of\\n#>#>|their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational.\\n#>#>\\n#>#>I can\\'t agree with this until you are specific - *which* theism?  To\\n#>#>say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which\\n#>#>I suspect you do not have.\\n#>#>\\n#>#\\n#>#Using the traditonal definition of gods. Personal, supernatural entities\\n#>#with objective effects on this world. Usually connected to morals and/or\\n#>#the way the world works.\\n#>\\n#>IMO, any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational.  That does\\n#>not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of\\n#>intelligence.  Some atheists are also scientists, for example.\\n#>\\n# \\n#They don\\'t use theism when doing science. Or it wouldn\\'t be science. Please\\n#note that subjective data lend themselves to a scientific treatment as well.\\n#They just prohibit formulating them as objective statements.\\n\\nErgo, nothing is objective.  Fair enough.\\n# \\n# \\n#>#>|The affinity to fanatism is easily seen. It has to be true because I believe\\n#>#>|it is nothing more than a work hypothesis. However, the beliefs say they are\\n#>#>|more than a work hypothesis.\\n#>#>\\n#>#>I don\\'t understand this.  Can you formalise your argument?\\n#>#\\n#>#Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice. That does not make\\n#>#B true, it is at best a work hypothesis. However, the content of B is that\\n#>#it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis. Testing or evaluating\\n#>#evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because B (already believed)\\n#>#says it is wronG/ a waste  of time/ not possible. Depending on the further\\n#>#contents of B Amalekites/Idolaters/Protestants are to be killed, this can\\n#>#have interesting effects.\\n#>\\n#>Peculiar definition of interesting, but sure.  Now show that a belief\\n#>in gods entails the further contents of which you speak.   Why aren\\'t my\\n#>catholic neighbours out killing the protestants, for example?   Maybe they\\n#>don\\'t believe in it.  Maybe it\\'s the conjunction of \"B asserts B\" and\\n#>\"jail/kill dissenters\" that is important, and the belief in gods is\\n#>entirely irrelevant.  It certainly seems so to me, but then I have no\\n#>axe to grind here.\\n#>\\n# \\n#The example with your neighbours is a fallacy. That *your* neighbours don\\'t\\n#says little about others. And there were times when exactly that happened.\\n\\nNope, it\\'s not a fallacy.   It just doesn\\'t go to the correlation you\\nwish to see.\\n# \\n#And tell me, when it is not irrelevant, why are such statements about\\n#Amalekites and Idolaters in the Holy Books? Please note that one could\\n#edit them out when they are not relevant anymore. Because gods don\\'t err?\\n#What does that say about that message?\\n\\nExcuse me - THE Holy Books?\\n# \\n#And how come we had theists saying genocides ordered by god are ok. A god\\n#is the easiest way to excuse anything, and therefore highly attracting to\\n#fanatics. Not to mention the effect interpretation by these fanatics can\\n#have on the rest of the believers.

       " 'This is a RFD on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a \\nsharing on the \"Johannine hours\" as proposed each month by the monks of \\nthe ecumenical community of Taize (pronounced te-zay) in France.\\n\\nNAME OF PROPOSED NEWSGROUP: \\n==========================\\n\\nsoc.religion.taize (Unmoderated)\\n\\n\\nPURPOSE OF THE GROUP: \\n====================\\n\\nThe Taize Community is an international ecumenical community of monks \\nbased in France. Many young adults come there to search for meaning in \\ntheir life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a \\nsharing with others. This newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a \\nmonthly \"Johannine Hour\" which will be posted at the beginning of each \\nmonth. A \"Johannine hour\" involves a short commentary on a given Bible \\npassage, followed by some questions for reflection.  Any thoughts that \\nmay arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be \\nposted here. We are not interested in theological debate, and even less \\nin polemics. No expertise is required! The idea is to help one another \\nto deepen our understanding of Scripture as it is related to our own \\nlife-journey.\\n\\nThe idea of \"Johannine hours\" was born in Taize as a simple response\\nto all those who were trying to assimilate the Bible\\'s message in the\\nmidst of their daily life. Because of work or studies, it is often\\nimpossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection, but\\neveryone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church, sit\\nquietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. There, in silence,\\nwe can meditate on a passage of Scripture to listen to the voice of\\nChrist.\\n\\nDuring the time of silence, it is important to concentrate on what we \\nunderstand and not waste time worrying if, in some Biblical expressions, \\nwe find it difficult to hear the voice of Christ. The idea is to \\ncommunicate to others what we have understood of Christ, not burdening \\nthem with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought \\nus joy, what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply.\\n\\nPerhaps those who read and think about the \"Johannine Hours\" in this\\nnewsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others.\\n\\nThe important thing is the complementarity between two aspects, the\\npersonal aspect of silent, personal reflection and the communal aspect\\nof sharing, which through Usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network.\\n\\nBACKGROUND OF THE TAIZE COMMUNITY:\\n=================================\\n\\nThe following provides some background information on the life and\\nvocation of the Taize (pronounced te-zay) community.\\n\\n\"A PARABLE OF COMMUNION\": August 1940, with Europe in the grip of\\nWorld War II, Brother Roger, aged 25, set up home in the almost\\nabandoned village of Taize, in Eastern France. His dream: to bring\\ntogether a monastic community which would live out \"a parable of\\ncommunity\", a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of\\nthe time. Centering his life on prayer, he used his house to conceal\\nrefugees, especially Jews fleeing from the Nazi occupation.\\n\\nAN INTERNATIONAL AND ECUMENICAL COMMUNITY: Taize\\'s founder spent the\\nfirst two years alone. Others joined him later and at Easter 1949,\\nseven brothers committed themselves together to common life and\\ncelibacy. Year by year, still others have entered the community, each\\none making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation.\\nToday, there are 90 brothers, Catholics and from various Protestant\\nbackgrounds, from over twenty different countries. Some of them are\\nliving in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in Asia, Africa, North\\nand South America. The brothers accept no donations or gifts for\\nthemselves, not even family inheritances, and the community holds no\\ncapital. The brothers earn their living and share with others\\nentirely through their own work. In 1966, Sisters of Saint Andrew, an\\ninternational Catholic community founded 750 years ago, came to live\\nin the neighbouring village, to share the responsibility of welcoming\\npeople in Taize.\\n\\nTAIZE AND THE YOUNG; THE INTERCONTINENTAL MEETINGS: Young adults, and\\nless young, have been coming to Taize in ever greater numbers since\\n1957. Hundreds of thousands of people from Europe and far beyond have\\nthus been brought together in a common search. Intercontinental\\nmeetings take place each week, Sunday to Sunday, throughout the year\\nand they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during any\\none week. The meetings give each person the opportunity to explore\\nthe roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner\\nlife and human solidarity. The meetings in summer can have up to\\n6,000 participants a week. Three times every day, the brothers and\\neverybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the Church\\nof Reconciliation, built in 1962 when the village church became too\\nsmall.\\n\\n\"A PILGRIMAGE OF TRUST ON EARTH\" The community has never wanted to\\ncreate a \"movement\" around itself. Instead, people are called to\\ncommit themselves in their church at home, in their neighbourhood,\\ntheir city or village. To support them in this, Taize has created\\nwhat it calls \"a pilgrimage of trust on earth\". At the end of each\\nyear, the pilgrimage has a \"European meeting\" which brings together\\ntens of thousands of young adults from every part of Europe for\\nseveral days in a major city. There have also been meetings in Asia\\nand in the United States. Every year, Brother Roger writes an open\\nletter to the young. Usually completed during a stay in one of the\\npoor regions of the world, these are translated into thirty languages\\nand provide themes for reflexion for the following year.\\n\\nNOTE:  Discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in \\n       news.groups.\\n\\nFor any further information contact: Brother.Roy@almac.co.uk\\n\\n               brother.roy@almac.co.uk',\n",

And to Holy Mary, Virgin is invariably added, for that Holy Woman\\n    remains undefiled.\\n                -- St. Epiphanus of Salamis, \"Panacea against all heresies\",\\n                   between A.D. 374-377.\\n\\n    We surely cannot deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine\\n    about children of Mary ... For the Lord Jesus would not have chosen\\n    to be born of a virgin if He had judged that she would be so incontinent\\n    as to taint the birthplace of the Body of the Lord, home of the Eternal\\n    King, with the seed of human intercourse.  Anyone who proposes this is\\n    merely proposing ... that Christ could not be born of a virgin.\\n                -- Pope St. Siricius, Letter to Anysius, Bishop of \\n                   Thessalonica, A.D. 392\\n\\nNote that St. Augustine\\'s conversion to Christianity was in A.D. 387.  I\\ndon\\'t know offhand when his election as bishop of Hippo was, but I\\'m quite\\nsure it was after 392.  The belief in Mary\\'s perpetual virginity originated\\nlong before Augustine\\'s time.  We hold that it originated with the \\nApostles.\\n\\nStrictly speaking, however, Mary\\'s perpetual virginity is independent\\nof her Immaculate Conception.  Mary could have been Immaculately \\nConceived and not remained a virgin; she could have remained a virgin\\nand not been Immaculately Conceived.\\n\\n\\nNo.  It has been held in the Church since ancient times that original\\nsin was transmitted at conception, when a person\\'s life begins.\\nBiology had nothing to do with it.  Prayerfully reflecting on the\\ntruth of Mary\\'s sinlessness, and the means by which God could have\\nachieved this, the Church arrived at the truth of the Immaculate\\nConception.  Thus, the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine,\\nbut the logical result of our understanding of two old ones.\\n\\nThe celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself was\\ngiven by Pope Sixtus IV (1471-84) and the Feast was made a precept\\nfeast of the Church by Pope Clement XI (1700-21).\\n\\n\\nNo.  First of all, Lourdes is private revelation, and doctrine is not\\nbased on private revelation.  The most that private revelation can do\\nis enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation,\\nwhich ended with the death of St. John the Apostle.\\n\\nSecond, the \"case for the doctrine\" was irreformably sealed in 1854 \\nwith the ex cathedra promulgation of the Bull \"Ineffabilis Deus\" by\\nPope Pius IX.  This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as\\na dogma; a dogma, by definition, cannot change and is required to be\\nbelieved by the faithful.\\n\\nThe apparition at Lourdes happened in 1858, four years later.  The most\\nthat might be claimed is that Lourdes gave the infallible proclamation\\nof 1854 a sort of heavenly stamp of approval, but the Church has never\\nclaimed that, nor shall she.\\n\\nIn Christ\\'s Peace,\\n\\nBrad Kaiser\\n(bradk@isdgsm.eurpd.csg.mot.com)',\n",

The concepts of \"right\"\\nand \"wrong\" (or \"correct/incorrect\" or \"true/false\") belong to the\\ndomain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no\\nsense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is\\nlegitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).\\n\\nLet me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives\\nof epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.\\nOne can certainly ask if a percept is \"right\" (correct, true,\\nveridical) or \"wrong\" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little\\nsense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is\\nstrange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can\\ncertainly ask that question about motives.\\n\\nTherefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can\\'t be considered:\\nthey assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.\\n\\nNow the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with\\nthe first part (that the \"rightness\" of a moral position is a\\nmeaningless question), for the reasons stated above.

What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little\\n& i\\'ve studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as \"dogs\"\\n& and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized\\n& gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least,\\n& that is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour?\\n\\nMotorcycle transmissions don\\'t have synchros.  The engagment dogs are very\\ncorse and sloppy.  There are maybe 6-10 teeth (dogs) on the side of the\\ngears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back\\nand forth.  To shift:  start to apply pressure at the same time the\\nclutch is pulled (the clutch is a hand lever) and shift quickly.  If \\nyou try a slow lazy shift it will grind, you just have to pop it into\\nthe next gear before it has a chance to grind.  There isn\\'t a neutral\\nbetween gears (obviously there is, but you can\\'t select it with the\\nshifter) so double clutching is not a possibility.  \"speed shifting\"\\n(which is what I have always heard \"clutchless shifting\" called) works\\npretty well for upshifts with some practice, but I usually use the\\nclutch-especially for the lower gears.\\n\\nI think auto (as in automobile) trannys are similar, except that the\\nengagment dogs are very fine, with no slop.  And the addition of\\nsyncho rings.  The gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions\\nthat are synchronized, but may not be in non-synchro gears (reverse\\nand sometimes first).  \\n',\n",

       " '\\n[ ... my stuff deleted ... ]\\n\\n\\nBill, you seem to have erroneously assumed that this board has as its\\nsole purpose the validation of atheism.  It doesn\\'t.  This board is\\nused to discuss atheism as a philosophy, to share posters\\' experiences\\nregarding atheism, to debunk various theisms and theism as a whole, to\\nshare resources relating to atheism, and even to socialize with others\\nwith similar views.  And of course with the number of theists who come\\nhere to preach, it is also used to argue the case for atheism. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you want to accuse people of lying, please do so directly.  The\\nphrase \"deliberately mistaken\" is rather oxymoronic.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe two forms of theism most often discussed here these days are\\nChristianity and Islam.  Both of these claim to make their followers\\ninto good people, and claim that much of benefit to humanity has been\\naccomplished through their faiths.  IMHO they are right.  The American\\nFriends Service Committee (Quaker), Catholic Relief Services, Bread\\nFor The World, Salvation Army soup kitchens, and Mother Theresa spring\\nto mind.  (Can someone with more knowledge of Islam supply the names\\nof some analagous Islamic groups?)  \\n\\nWhen Mother Theresa claims that her work is an outgrowth of her\\nChristianity, I believe her.  Her form of theism ascribes to her deity\\nsuch a benevolence toward humanity that it would be wrong not to care\\nfor those in need.  The point is that such a philosophy does have the\\npower to change the behavior of individuals;  if it is widespread\\nenough, it can change societies.\\n\\nThe same works for the horrors of history.  To claim that Christianity\\nhad little to do with the Crusades or the Inquisition is to deny the\\nawesome power that comes from faith in an absolute.  What it seems you\\nare doing twisting the reasonable statement that religion was never\\nthe solitary cause of any evil into the unreasonable statement that\\nreligion has had no evil impacts on history.  That is absurd.',\n",

       " '\\n\\nThis definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into\\nthe support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  There\\nwas little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of\\nstate universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.\\nThe US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was\\nmainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that\\nmany research universities, but they all provided their researchers with\\nlow teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for\\ntravel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a\\nuniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well\\nas salary.\\n\\nDuring WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure\\nscientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they \\nwere not exactly in the areas of the scientists\\' expertise.  This is\\nprobably because of the \"research mind\" approach, which is not to try\\nto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution\\nemerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to\\ndiscussion about their problems, the job got done.\\n\\nThe military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the\\nfuture, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was\\nunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the\\nfuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as \\nNSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly\\nkeep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,\\nmaking it more difficult for them to act to support research.\\n\\nThe worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which\\nthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,\\nand in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,\\nas has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of\\na graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask\\nfor one?  The answer I will get is, \"Get the money from NSF.\"  Now the\\nmoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it\\ncomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from\\ngetting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects\\nget supported, and how much.  \\n\\nAlso, the government decided that the \"wealth\" should be spread.  So instead\\nof having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research\\ninstitutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into\\nbeing.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating\\nreseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal\\nhas to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals\\nalready done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am\\nproposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find \\nimpossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow\\nI may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea\\nwhich solves yesterday\\'s too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to\\nsomething I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, \\nand except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it\\nis not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring \\nmore than minimal attention of a good researcher.  \\n\\nI believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would\\nhave happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government\\nis trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.',\n",

I agree that arrogance is not the result\\nof religion and that God is a far better judge than we are.  I also agree if\\nyou mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove one\\'s\\nsuperior knowledge, rightness, or holiness over another person\\'s beliefs.\\n\\nI need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that I do not fall\\ninto the mistake of misrepresenting your views.  If I fall down in this area\\nI hope you will forgive me.\\n\\nArrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that\\none\\'s God is greater than the god\\'s of others or of believing that one\\'s\\nreligion is better than other religions.  These are all naturally self-implied\\nbeliefs.\\n\\nIt is self-contradictory to say that I believe my current beliefs to be wrong.\\nWere I to find myself in error, my beliefs would naturally change and follow\\nwhat I believe to be right.  Therefore, I must always consider my beliefs\\ncorrect.  That\\'s not arrogance.  That\\'s unavoidable behavior.\\n\\nIt is nonsense to say that I believe another person\\'s god to be greater than\\nmy God.  Were his or her god greater, wouldn\\'t I be obligated to change so\\nthat their god would become my God?  We are naturally obligated to worship\\nthat God which we deem to be the greatest.  Why should we feel obligated to\\nworship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble?\\n\\nArrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more\\nintelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person.  No\\ndoubt many will have to chew on this one awhile.  Were passive observation\\nof one\\'s superior points arrogance, then God would be most arrogant of all.\\n\\nHumility does not rest in slandering or belittling God\\'s work of creation in\\nour lives.  People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another,\\n\"I\\'m not very smart.  I\\'m poor.  I\\'m not good looking.  I\\'m just a worm in\\nthe ground.  I\\'m such a weak person and although I don\\'t want to sin, I\\nreally cannot help it.\"  Were this person truely humble, he would take a\\ndifferent approach.  \"God, thank you for making me the way you did.  I know\\nthat you never do anything second best.  Yet with all that you have given me,\\nI have been so unthankful.  You\\'ve given me power to resist the devil.  I\\nhave not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said\\nnot to do.  I have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself\\nwith humility for doing so.  Lord, with all you\\'ve given me, I have been\\ncompletely unfaithful and I do not deserve your forgiveness.  And, yet Your\\nlove for me is so boundless that you would give Yourself to die for me to\\nsave me.  As terribly evil as I am, I deserve to go straight to hell, yet it\\npleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life I\\'ve led.  Lord,\\nplease forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that I can bring\\nglory to Your Name instead of insult.  Lord I\\'m so sorry for my wrongs.  Please\\nhelp me to change.\"\\n\\n: \\n: I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because\\n: they don\\'t want to be wrong.  If I find someone arrogant, I typically\\n: don\\'t have anything to do with them.\\n\\nFor me, I\\'ve often found it hard to tell the difference.  Often times, the\\nmost humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most\\nproud \"worm in the ground\" false humility type person has been found to be\\nmost comfortable company.\\n\\nWhen I\\'m wrong and arrogant about my wrongness, I certainly don\\'t feel like\\nbeing confronted by my wrongness.  Were someone to confront me verbally with\\nmy wrongness, I\\'d be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for\\nall their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me.\\nAt the root, my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about\\nliving my life arrogantly as I wish.  However, were someone to confront me\\nsilently by their example, earn my respect, and perhaps mention it to me in\\nhumility in private, I\\'d feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help\\nin changing from the error of my ways.\\n\\nThe hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone\\nregardless of their humility or pride--regardless of their hypocricy or\\nsincerity--regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not.\\nIt isn\\'t easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity\\nto improve in one\\'s ability to serve God.  It\\'s easier to cast aside any hope\\nof reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God\\'s creation\\nin our lives instead.\\n\\n: But we should examine ourselves [I hope I typed this back in right]\\n: and why we react to certain situations with such emotions.  For instance,\\n: many of us feel \"justified\" to be insulted by an arrogant person.  As if\\n: we needed a reason to feel insulted.  But after being insulted over and\\n: over again by the words of others, you\\'d think we\\'d either toughen up\\n: or decide not to be insulted, or ignore the insult.  Just because you\\n: can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage, that doesn\\'t make that\\n: reaction the appropriate one.  It is in this light of self-examination\\n: that we can change our emotional reactions.\\n: \\n\\nSometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between\\nwhat is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous\\nstatement of our character.  The devil is the accuser of the bretheren.  He\\nwould love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant\\nand self-righteous where we are indeed wrong.  The devil\\'s aim is to get us\\ninto as much misery as he can.  Just think of the devil as a cruel and merci-\\nless criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children with\\nhot irons.

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\\n\\n\\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \\nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \\nTribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \\nsaved.\" - Matthew 24:13\\n\\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\\n\\n\\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\\nthe rapture until Christ\\'s second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob\\'s\\n(Israel\\'s) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel\\'s Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \\nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\\n\\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\\n\\n\\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \\n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \\npossession during the Tribulation.\\n\\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\\n\\n\\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \\nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\\nunfold before you.  \\n\\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\\n\\n\\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \\nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \\nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\\nsake of Christ.  \\n\\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\\n\\n\\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \\nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \\nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \\n\\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \\nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist\\'s\\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \\nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \\nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\\n\\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \\nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \\nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \\ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\\nthe mark.  \\n\\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \\nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \\nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \\npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \\n14:9-10 \\n\\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \\n\\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\\n\\n\\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist\\'s government\\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \\nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\\n\\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist\\'s control will come last to the least\\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \\nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\\nclosings\" --M] \\nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \\nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\\n\\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\\n\\t\\n\\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist\\'s\\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\\n\\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\\n\\n\\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \\n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \\nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \\npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \\npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\\n\\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \\nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\\n\\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\\n\\n\\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \\nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \\n\\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \\nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\\n\\n\\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\\n\\n******************************************************************************\\nMike Cluff\\t\\t\\t\\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\\t*  \\n******************************************************************************\\n\\n\\n/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\ \\n\\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \\n\\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.',\n",

The estimated population\\n of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were\\n Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.\\n Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third\\n of Transcaucasia\\'s Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \\n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province\\'s ethnic character \\n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \\n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \\n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \\n (See also Map 1.

And so we\\nbaptize infants.\\n\\n   To summarize, you accused the original poster of saying if something\\nis not forbidden by the Bible, then that proves it is OK; i.e. if\\nsomething cannot be disproven, it is true.  He rather seemed to be\\nasserting that since the Bible does not forbid, _you cannot prove_,\\nusing the Bible, that it is _not_ OK.  There is a difference between\\nproving whether or not something can be proven or disproven (there are\\ntheories on provability in the field of Logic, by the way) and actually\\nproving or disproving it.  The other logical error we must avoid falling\\ninto is the converse: that if something cannot be proven, then it is\\nfalse.  This seems to be the error of many _sola scriptura_ believers.\\n\\n   I think the only thing that can be proven here is that one cannot use\\nScripture alone to prove something either way about infant Baptism,\\nalthough the evidence seems to me to favor it.\",\n",

       " 'REFLECTIONS ON BOSNIA\\n\\nLORD OWEN AND THE SERBS\\n\\nIn early February \\'93, Lord Owen made appearances in New York City\\non the Donahue and Charlie Rose shows. On a couple of occasions on\\nthose shows Lord Owen gave away his pro-Serbian position when he\\nmade the point that much or most of the Bosnian territory then in\\ndispute or already overrun by Serbian forces had been controlled\\nand occupied by Serbs before WWII.  It was as if he were saying\\nthat since the Serbs had previously occupied those territories and\\nlost them during the Hitler years, they should be allowed to\\nreconquer them today.\\n\\nI was familiar with this view because my father, a Yugoslav Jew\\nwho escaped to this country during the war, was aided and found\\nsympathy among the Serbs during those harrowing years.  In recent\\nmonths when the subject of Serbian aggression was mentioned, my\\nfather would make the point that 850,000 Serbs were killed by Nazi\\nand pro-Nazi Croatian forces known as the Ustasha.  My father is\\nso pro-Serbian that he dismissed reports of Serbian atrocities. My\\nfather also excoriated New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis,\\nbecause, my father said, Anthony Lewis \"is always talking about\\nthe Muslims.\"\\n\\nUpdate--April 28, 1993 After an uneasy truce in and around\\nSbernica, shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and\\nthe killing and the misery continues apace while the Clinton\\nadministration dithers its response.  In the days leading to the\\ncollapse of resistance at Sbernica, Lord Owen changed his tune.\\nPreviously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds\\nthat it would endanger U.N. relief workers. When Serbian forces\\nbegan to march on Sbernica, the threat to U.N. relief soldiers\\nwent unmentioned while Lord Owen called for outside intervention\\nto stop Serbian aggression, including the use of air strikes.  The\\ncurrent disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the West\\nand a failure of the Vance-Owen initiative which did nothing to\\nhalt the Serbs. Now that it\\'s too late to save Muslim areas that\\nLord Owen felt should be in a Muslim state, Lord Owen belatedly\\ncalls for strong action.\\n\\nCLINTON AND BOSNIA\\n\\nIn the summer of 1992, George Kenney, a senior State Department\\nofficial, the undersecretary in charge of the Yugoslav desk, made\\nnews when he resigned from the State Department because of the\\nBush administration\\'s refusal to take any action to halt Serbian\\naggression.  As Kenney saw it, Bush\\'s inaction was largely due to\\nthe president\\'s unwillingness to risk any political capital by\\ngetting involved there.\\n\\nApparently the same is true of the Clinton administration.\\nClinton gives the impression that he cares more than Bush did\\nabout the terrible ongoing tragedy, but the practical effect has\\nso far been the same.\\n\\nAccording to the New York Times, (4/16/93) the Clinton\\nadministration did everything it could to suppress a mid-March\\nreport by its own experts which called for military action if\\nnecessary to protect \"safe havens\" for the Muslims. At one point,\\nSenate majority leader, George Mitchell was so incensed that the\\nreport was kept from Congress, that he called for an\\ninvestigation.\\n\\nInstead of helping the desperate Bosnians, Clinton has signalled\\nagain and again that Milosevic and the Serbs are free to do what\\nthey want in Bosnia--indeed, Clinton and the West have been\\nsignalling that the Serbs should get on with the job and finish\\noff the Bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other\\nway.  A key signal was when Clinton made it clear that he would\\nNOT send in American military forces on the ground.  On this\\nissue, Clinton has made me wistful for Bush.  Bush and Baker could\\nnot have done worse, and might have been pressured to do better\\nwell before this time.  Lives in Bosnia might have been saved and\\nthe destruction might have been curtailed..\\n\\nThe Nation, the left and \"the Bosnian QUANDARY\"\\n\\nTypical of the left\\'s inability to come to grips with the core\\nissue involved in Bosnia, i.e., a clear aggressor destroying\\nhundreds of thousands of lives, is the editorial on the \"Bosnian\\nquandary\" in The Nation (4/26/93).  In the end the editorial votes\\nto do nothing, even while noticing \"the ghastly atrocities of the\\nBosnian Serbs\"  and that the \"greater and lesser powers...dither\\nand fuss [and] hang back.\" (\"Before anything else happens, the\\nClinton Administration ought to pay the $530 million the United\\nStates owes the\" U.N. the editorial concludes.)\\n\\nIn its most striking passage, the editorial writer warns that\\n\"those who are pushing President Clinton to intervene on the side\\nof the Bosnians had better review U.S. foreign policy since World\\nWar II.\"  The editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the\\nBosnian Serbs are no worse than any number of U.S. clients\\nincluding the Chileans, the South Africans, the Greek fascists and\\nothers. (In a subsequent column for The Nation, Christopher\\nHitchens correctly called this editorial, \"contemptible.\")\\n\\n***\\n\\nWilliam Pfaff, a European based journalist who writes for the The\\nNew Yorker and the Los Angeles Times, is among a group of liberal\\ncolumnists like Anthony Lewis, and Leslie Gelb who have clearly\\nand consistently called for strong Western and American\\nintervention to stop the Serbs.  Pfaff\\'s most recent column\\n(Liberal Opinion Week 4/19/93) is entitled \"International\\nCowardice Worsened Bosnian Tragedy.\"\\n\\nHe clarifies the international failure which has led to present\\nsituation in one sentence. \"Having refused to intervene to\\nsanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent\\nCroatia in June 1991, or to block or penalize the military\\naggression by Serbia that immediately followed, and the atrocious\\n\"ethnic cleansing\" which followed that, the United Nations now\\ncontemplates deploying in Bosnia military force on a scale which\\ntwo years ago could have deterred the horrors Yugoslavia has since\\nexperienced.\"  He goes on to explain that U.N. plans now envisaged\\ncall for a \"more daunting and open-ended military assignment than\\na direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have\\nbeen a year ago.\"\\n\\nAryeh Neier on the Serbs In his \"Watching Rights\" column in the\\nThe Nation (5/3/93) Aryeh Neier gets to the heart of the\\nmotivation of the \"aggressors\"--the preferred term for the Serbian\\nforces who have been besieging and shelling Sarajevo for more than\\na year.  He explains that \"there is no  military purpose that is\\nserved by the destruction of its fabric and its people...Above\\nall, few of those aligned with the forces attacking Sarajevo would\\nwant to live there even if the city could be rebuilt.  They are\\nnot city people.\\n\\n\"It is this, I believe--aside from a desire to break the morale of\\nBosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at\\nany price--that explains the conduct of the siege of\\nSarajevo...[I]t is a loathing for all that is urban, pluralist and\\ncosmopolitan that has made Sarajevo the object for devastation.\\n\\n\"Historically, most of the Serbian population in Bosnia and\\nHerzegovina has been rural, while Muslims, who were the civil\\nservants and intelligentsia during the centuries of Ottoman rule,\\nmade up a disproportionate share of the urban population....The\\ndestruction of Sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility\\nagainst this city; it is also an attack on the urban idea....The\\ndemagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war\\nexploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred\\nfor all that is cosmopolitan.\"\\n\\nThe light that Neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is\\nat stake.  The Serbs represent the know-nothing, anti-secularist,\\nfundamentalist, fascist forces who are attacking the urban,\\ncosmopolitan, secular, multi-cultural idea.  They are attacking\\nthe rest of us, just as Hitler did. One irony is that at the\\nbeginning of the crisis over Bosnia, it was for awhile maintained\\nby the Serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a\\nthreat by the Bosnian Muslims to create a fundamentalist state.\\n\\nNeier has shown that it is the Serbs who are  the great threat to\\nsecularism, multi-culturalism, diversity and democracy.  It\\'s the\\nSerbs who are attacking the democratic notion, the democratic\\nidea.\\n\\nAnthony Lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does\\nrespect for Clinton\\'s presidency \"depend...on his acting\\neffectively against Serbian aggression?...First of all because to\\ndo nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values\\nwe and our allies profess.\"  (Times, 4/26/93) But it\\'s not merely\\na betrayal of our values.  It\\'s because the Serbs are attacking us\\nby proxy, just as Hitler was.\\n\\nOne argument for decisive action by the West that is heard in a\\ndifferent form, is that war in the Balkans is destablizing for\\nEurope.  We hear it as, the Bosnians are Europe\\'s Palestinians;\\nthat is to say, just as the Palestinian refugee problem has been\\nthe key to instability in the Middle East, just so will the\\nhundreds of thousands of Yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities\\nresult in turmoil in Europe for decades to come.\\n\\nOne of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though\\nthe Atlantic Ocean divides us, the Americas are ultimately tied to\\nthe destiny of Europe. If Europe is destabilized, the U.S. will\\ninevitably be affected and drawn into its problems.  As in a\\nwhirlpool,  sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom.\\nAnd as past history and Pfaff have shown, it\\'s much better if we\\ndo so decisively, quickly and on our terms.',\n",

       " 'Stuff deleted\\n\\nI reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little\\njustification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur\\'an.\\nIn Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished. \\nBelief is considered a matter of conscience and since there\\nis to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have\\nbeen generally left to believe or not believe as they will.\\n\\nHowever, when an apostate makes attacks upon \"God and\\nHis Messenger\" the situation changes. Now the charge of\\napostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps \\ncharges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person \\nmakes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public\\nattacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the\\nsituation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads\\nslander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation\\nchanges. The punishments vary according to the situation\\nthe apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated\\napostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie\\'s case.\\n\\nThere is a distinction in the Qur\\'an between a formal war situation\\nand being in the situation where someone unilaterally\\nwages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc. \\nagainst the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm \\nto Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could\\nbe said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is\\na clear difference between a formal war situation (where two\\nclearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange\\nprisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated\\nindividuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation, \\nthe unilateral attack and the spreading of \"fasad\" that \\nwould apply in the case of Rushdie.\\n\\nThe matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an \\noffensive book (banning the book is secondary) -\\na full set of circumstances following the publication of\\nthe book come into play as well, including the deaths of many\\nMuslims, and Rushdie\\'s (and his publishers) Media games.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. I believe\\nthat one of the Qur\\'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33.\\nEvery verse in the Qur\\'an has a corresponding \"circumstance of\\nrevelation\" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the\\nverse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance\\nin which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say\\nthat all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the\\nMuslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when\\nthey were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life\\nsituations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can\\nall be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal\\nrelationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that\\narriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how\\neach applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task.\\nIt is not necessarily a simple \"this or that\" process. There may\\nbe many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in\\nwhich a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters\\nimpinge on the situation.\\n\\nIn other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur\\'an.\\nThe Qur\\'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must\\nentail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith.\\nIf the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each\\nperson has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that.\\nHowever, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to\\nthe\\nState, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society,\\nthe dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there \\nare certain minimum requirements of understanding that one \\nshould achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of \\nthese requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:\\n\\n\"...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating\\nverse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one,\\nand a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between\\na permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of\\nMeccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances \\nof revelation, and does not understand the technical words of\\nthe Qur\\'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the\\nknowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and\\ndelaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from\\nthe deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning\\nfrom the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer,\\nthe disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive,\\nand is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the\\nsubsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the\\ndetailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the\\nduties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and\\ndoes not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those\\ncoming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know\\nthe Qur\\'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur\\'an....\".\\n\\nBased on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur\\'anic\\nverses (\"Why should not a company from every group remain behind \\nto gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn \\npeople when they return to them, so that they may beware.\" (9:122)),\\na science of jurisprudence arose.

I\\'ve listed a few major \\ndivisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these\\nheadings.\\n\\n- Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory).\\n- Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir.\\n- Logic (mantiq)\\n- A knowledge of Hadiths\\n- A knowledge of transmitters (rijal)\\n- Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur\\'an, Sunnah, Consensus,\\nReasoning)\\n\\nThe study of Qur\\'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves:\\n- discussion of imperatives (awamir)\\n- discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi)\\n- discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas)\\n- discussion of unconditional and conditional\\n- discussion of tacit meanings\\n- discussion of the abstract and the clear\\n- discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated\\n\\nThe principles of Application of the law involves:\\n- principles of exemption\\n- principles of precaution\\n- principles of option\\n- principles of mastery\\n\\nThe jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process\\nin pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter\\nof looking at one verse and one hadith. \\n\\nNow no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference\\nbetween blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is\\nclearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the\\n\"The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as \\nlong as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures,\\nand wealth of this world.\" The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: \"O Messenger\\nof God! How may we know if they so concern themselves?\" He (S.A.) replied:\\n\"By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for\\nyour religion and shun them.\" I do not yet know enough about the Imams\\nof the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies\\nto them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.\\n\\nThe Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as \"The fortress of Islam\". My only\\npoint is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into\\nplay a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is \\ndelineated in the Qur\\'an and hadith.

I think\\nit was also shown during the Calgary-LA game. \\n\\n(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)\\n\\nTopics\\n------\\n\\nDon\\'s Tie, Doug Gilmour, Wings/Leafs, Quebec/Montreal, Boston/Buffalo,\\nWendel Clark, Fighting and Stickwork.\\n\\nEpisode Summary\\n---------------\\n\\nOnce again, the episode started with a shot of Don\\'s tie... This\\nwas a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the\\ncharacters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the\\nCat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc.\\n\\nRon Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs\\ngame. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players \"They\\nwon in their building, we\\'re going to win in ours\".\\n\\nDon then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour\\nhas never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he\\ngot 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that\\nhe gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible\\nfor his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour\\nfrom the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk\\nresulting in a goal.\\n\\nOn the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in\\nthe first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed\\nhowever, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells\\nthe Leaf players \"Don\\'t let them score on you\".\\n\\nRon brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal\\nwon that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner\\ndisqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don\\nthought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of\\ninstant replay.\\n\\nOn the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning\\nthe series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr.\\nFuhr should be getting 1/2 the team\\'s playoff checks for his\\nplay.\\n\\nWendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance\\nduring the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying\\nthat he can\\'t play the way he should, because of the league\\'s\\nnew rules. \"This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its\\nall hack and slash.\" Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the\\nproblems.\\n\\nDon\\'s opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings\\nGM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray\\nwas shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination\\nof fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article\\nin which Murray makes the following statements: \"Players don\\'t fight\\nbecause they\\'re afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.\\nInstead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing\\neach other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there\\nwouldn\\'t be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game.\"\\n\\nDon warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to \"smarten up\" with\\nfighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used\\nto be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights,\\nsomeone gets cut every period.\\n\\nRating\\n------\\nTypical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don\\'s opinion is supported\\nby Murray.',\n",

A \"quick\\nlook\" doesn\\'t do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah. Having\\nstudied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one\\nstage of my life, I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying\\ntheological meaning in the judgement prophesies. Let me make one point.\\nThe clash between Jeremiah and the \"false prophets\" was primarily in\\nthe theological realm. The \"false prophets\" understood their relatioship\\nto God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David. It is\\npossible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant,\\nwhich was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David\\'s\\ndescendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part\\nof the Lord to keep a descendant of David\\'s upon the throne and to never\\nallow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. Jeremiah was not a\\nJudahite prophet. He was from Anathoth, across the border in what had formerly\\nbeen Israelite territory. When he came to prophesy, he came from the\\ntheological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel\\nthrough Moses. The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant\\nafter the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of the\\nlocal prophets. It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic\\ncovenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah\\nspoke his prophesies. The \"judgement prophesies\" were deeply loaded with\\ntheological meaning.\\n\\nIn my opinion, both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson\\n\"New York will burn\" prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic\\ntheological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies.\\n\\n--\\n                                                                     ___\\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---',\n",

       " '4/23/93    BLUES SHUTOUT HAWKS AGAIN, LEAD SERIES 3-0\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\nIt was a great atmosphere last night at the St. Louis Arena as Joseph and\\nthe Blues shutout the Hawks for the second consecutive game. People were\\ncheering the Blues long before face-off time, and they kept going for the\\nentire game. My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning\\nhours with some of the players. Here\\'s a game summary from the St. Louis\\nPost-Disptach. Enjoy...\\n\\nBy Dave Luecking\\nOf The Post-Dispatch Staff:\\n\\nAt 10:24 p.m. Friday night, The Arena crowd of 17,965 paid homage to Blues\\ngoalie Curtis Joseph. The fans began bowing, their arms extended, taking the\\nthe lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``Only God Saves More Than\\nJoseph.\"  It was a fitting tribute to Joseph, who has brought the Blues to\\nthe verge of a surprising sweep.\\n\\nJoseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday, blanking the Blackhawks\\n3-0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3-0\\nlead in the best-of-seven series.\\n\\nThe Blackhawks haven\\'t scored against Joseph since the 8:51 mark of the second\\nperiod of Game 1. Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds,\\na Blues record. Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146:28, set in the\\nfirst round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers, one of only\\ntwo series the Blues have sweeped in their history.\\n\\nThe Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4,\\na nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday. The Blues have had\\nonly two sweeps in franchise history, both in 1969, when they swept\\nPhiladelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals.\\n\\nThe shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to\\nmake 47 saves. This time, the Blues held the shots down to 34, and the\\nBlackhawks couldn\\'t touch Joseph.\\n\\nWell, they touched Joseph, numerous times, shoving him and pushing him at \\nevery opportunity to try to get him off his game. But Joseph and the Blues\\nwere unfazed, dishing out their own punishment along the way.\\n\\nThe Blues\\' grinders -- Bob Bassen, Rich Sutter, Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry --\\nwore down the Blackhawks, taking the visitors from Chicago off their game.\\nThe grinders set the stage for the glamour boys, the gifted playmakers and\\nscorers, who made the most of their opportunities.\\n\\nCraig Janney, Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored, getting one goal in each\\nperiod. Hull assisted on Janney\\'s first-period power play goal after two unwise\\nChicago penalties. Checker Miller set up Hull\\'s goal in the second period, and\\nrookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson, who scored at 16:44 of the final \\nperiod.\\n\\nBlues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling\\n``Sweep. Sweep. Sweep.\" They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour \\n``Bell-Four. Bell-Four.\" They also chanted ``Na, na-na-na, hey-hey good bye.\"\\n\\nSuch talk is a tad premature. There\\'s still one game left, but the Blues are\\non a roll. They have the Blackhawks on their heels.\\n\\nThe Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first\\nminute of play. Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment, and Brendan Shanahan\\ndumped Steve Smith at center ice.\\n\\nChicago tried to retaliate, but Troy Murray\\'s decision to run into Joseph\\nbackfired. Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty.\\n\\nThe Blues didn\\'t get a shot on goal on the power play, and they survived a\\nscare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to\\nSteve Larmer. Joseph stopped Larmer\\'s shot and everything else Chicago threw\\nat him in the first period. The \\'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph\\nabout shooting high and continued to shoot low, where Joseph\\'s butterfly\\nstyle is deadly.\\n\\nRookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the\\nperiod -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two\\nshots on goal, as many as Miller. The Blues\\' penalty killer twice stole the\\npuck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour.\\n \\nMarouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up.\\nHe caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican\\'s third\\npenalty. He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14:58,\\nand gave the Blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when Christian Ruuttu\\nslashed Shanahan.\\n\\nThe Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play, and Hull got it\\nwhere he likes it -- in the high slot. Hull\\'s shot hit Belfour\\'s right\\nshoulder, and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. Belfour\\ndived back to cover, but the puck squirted loose to Janney, who poked it into\\nthe net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs.\\n\\nThe Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended, and the\\nBlackhawks lost their composure. Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds\\nremaining in the period, and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by\\nshooting the puck into the Blues\\' bench.\\n\\nChris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice, and\\nMarouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct. Chicago survived the Blues\\'\\npower play, but the loss of Chelios hurt. He didn\\'t return until the midway\\npoint of the period, and within three minutes of his return, Hull had increased\\nthe Blues\\' lead to 2-0, deflecting in Miller\\'s crisp pass.\\n\\nTry as they might, the Blackhawks couldn\\'t get to Joseph, who stopped\\neverything they could throw at him. He stopped 12 shots in the second period\\nand 13 more in the third. Chicago also hit the goalpost twice.\\n\\nEmerson\\'s goal put the game away. He went hard to the net and redirected\\nFelsner\\'s pass.',\n",

Whatever the\\n > thorn was, apparently it was not compatible with Christianity,\\n > yet does that make his epistles any less?\\n\\nPaul mentions his \"thorn\" (SKOLOPS, actually a sharp stake) in 2\\nCorinthians 12:7-9\\n\\n + And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of\\n + revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of\\n + Satan, to harass me, to keep me from being too elated. Three\\n + times I besought the Lord about this, that it should leave me;\\n + but he said to me, \"My grace is sufficient for you, for my\\n + power is made perfectr in weakness.\"\\n\\nHe does not explain what it was, but it need not have been a moral\\nproblem.  One guess is that Paul had a disorder of the eyes. He\\nordinarily dictated his letters, and then added a personal note and\\nhis signature. At the end of the letter to the Galatians, he says,\\n\"See, I am writing in large letters with my own hand,\" or else, \"See\\nwhat a long letter I have written with my own hand.\" If the former\\ntranslation is adopted, it seems that Paul could not write in the\\nsmall script of a practiced writer, but needed to make his letters\\nlarger, and this suggests eye problems. Again, he says to the\\nGalatians (4:13-15),\\n\\n + You know that it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached\\n + the gospel to you at first; and although my condition was a trial\\n + to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an\\n + angel of God.... For I bear you witness that, if possible, you\\n + would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.\\n\\nPerhaps this last line means simply, \"You would have done anything\\nfor me, not withholding your most precious possessions (your eyes).\"\\nBut in that case, we would expect some wording like, \"If I had\\nneeded them.\" \"If it were possible\" sounds as though the bodily\\nailment was connected with his eyes.\\n\\nWilliam Barclay, in his volume on Acts, makes a more specific\\nsuggestion.  Before Paul preached in the highlands of Galatia, he\\nhad been preaching in the coastal areas of Asia Minor. If he had had\\na malarial attack while there, a doctor would have advised him to\\nleave the low country and head for the hills.

       " 'Review of 1989 Ford Taurus SHO -- By Gene Kim\\n=============================================\\n\\nBackground:\\n\\n    Last week, I bought a 1989 Ford Taurus SHO, moving up from driving\\na 1987 Toyota Celica ST and a 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass.  I have been\\ninterested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing\\nthe classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought a\\nremarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800.\\nAs far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I still\\nhave another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.\\n\\n    As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car was\\nalready refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well as\\nhaving been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments.\\nHowever, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I\\ncan get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, the\\ncar received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinum\\nplugs and valve adjustment.\\n\\n    For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate.\\nThe clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents,\\nalthough the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small\\nscratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the\\nhighway.\\n\\n    Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bit\\nconcerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  To\\nmy surprise, the size of the car doesn\\'t bother me at all -- it seems\\njust as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-)\\nVisibility from the driver\\'s seat is excellent, helped mostly by of\\nthe small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and\\nin front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bit\\nmore difficult, but other than that, I love the size.\\n\\n    In fact, I\\'m starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up\\nfor a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on the\\nride later in this review.\\n\\n\\nEngine:\\n    \\n    As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was very\\ninterested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha \"Shogun\" engine.  I was not\\ndisappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is\\ngood.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, although\\nI don\\'t make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly\\n-- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is good\\nsince the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car.\\n(More on this later.)\\n\\n    While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be\\nunremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hit\\nhigher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you can\\nliterally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve\\nmore valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, and\\nyou are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around.\\nThe engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!\\n\\n    I\\'ve noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch the\\ntach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000,\\nyou may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than\\nadequate, it doesn\\'t come fully online until those other 12 valves\\nare used.\\n\\n\\nTransmission:\\n\\n    When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they\\nmarvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter\\ninto the car.  I remember driving a friend\\'s parent\\'s SHO in 1990, and\\nremember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the\\ncar in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.\\n\\n    The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a\\nFord recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the\\none on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bit\\nlarger and more forgiving.\\n\\n    When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter\\nfelt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you\\'d expect\\nit to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it\\'s\\nmuch the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it\\'s\\na clumsy shifter.\\n\\n    When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impress\\nfriends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily for\\nthe 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find this\\npretty amazing in a car like this.\\n\\n    It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest\\nshifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to my\\nToyota and my friend\\'s Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy.\\nSomeone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-line\\nbecause of the incredibly clumsy shifter.\\n\\n    I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more\\nreasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter works\\nsmoothly with no surprises.  I don\\'t know whether the rod shifter\\nupgrade would help at all.\\n\\n    Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gears\\nsmoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care to\\nmatch revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This took\\nseveral days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problems\\nwere because I\\'ve never had a car with enough power to balk at bad\\nshifts in higher gears.)\\n\\n    Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifter\\nrefuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to \\nget it into gear.  I\\'ll be watching this carefully in the next couple\\nof months.\\n\\n    A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500\\nrpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the\\nengine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger can\\ndefinitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car,\\nas do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a \"SHO\\nsound\" and is the gearbox -- apparently called \"gear rollover\".\\nReplies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review.\\n\\n\\nExterior:\\n\\n    As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of this\\nSHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are\\nvirtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimes\\ndon\\'t age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford did\\ndifferently to the SHO bodies.\\n\\n    The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matching\\ncolor body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, the\\nSHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at\\nstoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination.\\n:-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completely\\nmonochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with\\n\"SHO\" stenciled in relief.  I\\'ve seen a couple SHOs whose owners have\\ncolored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.\\n\\n    I don\\'t think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feel\\nalmost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different and\\ndistinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-)\\n\\n\\nInterior:\\n\\n    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don\\'t deserve the\\ncar.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter are\\ncovered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done in\\na black/grey/metallic scheme.  \\n\\n    The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedo\\nand 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, a\\nlarge compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrest\\nthat contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coin\\nholders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holding\\ncassette tapes.  There\\'s map-holders in the doors, and an oddly small\\nglove compartment.\\n\\n    I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted\\nto find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a\\nsink.  Hey, I\\'m really impressed with the ergonomics and\\nthoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it\\'s a 1989, before the\\ninterior was upgraded!\\n\\n    The backseat is bigger than any car I\\'ve had.  Why do they need so\\nmuch space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)\\n\\n    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  From\\nwhat I hear, it\\'s not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear.\\nMine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver\\'s has\\ncracked and I\\'m not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the\\nway.\\n\\n    A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don\\'t have a normal\\nhand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake that\\nyou press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I\\'m getting used to\\nit, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me.\\n\\n\\nRide:\\n\\n    The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It\\'s stiffer than\\nany car I\\'ve had.  A friend\\'s new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauter\\nand is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer with\\nless ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is a\\nnoisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feels\\nwonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn\\'t flex at all -- I\\nlistened for that before I bought the car.\\n\\n    On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car from\\nChicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alone\\nfrom trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It\\'s a relatively\\nquiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I\\'ve tried to find out what\\nexactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the window\\nthat rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.\\n\\n    Over the past three days, I\\'ve oscillated between thinking the\\nsuspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way\\ntoo rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I would\\nadvise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I\\'ve discovered, as with\\nthe shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you\\'ll have no reason\\nto complain.  Let me explain...\\n\\n    The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the\\nwheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer\\nmaking the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, I\\navoid the limits of traction -- and I\\'m a happy camper again.\\n\\n    It\\'s not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.\\n\\n    As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy.\\nMy first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the\\nwheel at highway speeds.

Also, I wish the\\n\\tside bolsters would close more tightly.  \\n\\n    I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I\\n\\tcurrently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500\\n\\tfor four.\\n\\n    I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it\\n\\tto use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don\\'t\\n\\treally mind...  and sometimes think it\\'s an okay idea!!!\\n\\tPretty ridiculous, though.\\n\\n    Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But,\\n\\tthis is no big deal.  There is more than enough torque\\n\\tdown low.\\n\\n    I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  It\\n\\ttook me a couple of days before I could really shift\\n\\tsmoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn\\'t it?)\\n\\n    My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted that\\n\\tit is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO. \\n\\tAstute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can make\\n\\tmy SHO last -- I just bought a book titled \"Drive It Forever\"\\n\\tfor tips in this department.  :-)\\n\\n    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I once\\n\\tparked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch\\n\\tafter I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced off\\n\\tthe car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car \\n\\tis a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began \\n\\tto wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of \\n\\tparking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed \\n\\tthe glowing brake light.

It also seems that the term \"Easter\" is only used by the English \\nand those they evangelized. The Germans, for example, also use the term \\n\"Ostern\", but Germany was evangelized by English missionaries.\\n\\nSo I would be interested in any evidence of \"Easter\" being used for Pascha \\nby people who do not have any kind of connection with the ancient Anglo-\\nSaxons and their offshoots.

If you would like more info on the ministry,\\nand/or would like to comment on whether you found this teaching beneficial,\\ne-mail to Randy Hunt at rlhunt@hou.amoco.com.\\n\\n\\nLOVE IN THE MORNING  (Psalm 90:14)\\n\\nby Malcolm Smith\\n\\nMoses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of Israel. A generation\\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\\nthan God\\'s way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\\nat Kadesh and had God\\' s promise of one day entering the land. The\\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt\\'s gods as He led\\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What\\' s next on the miracle menu?\"\\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men\\'s lives had hung\\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God\\'s glorious\\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God\\'s love is not an emotion\\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\\nmother\\'s love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love\\'s excitement, a love\\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents\\' love is\\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents\\' love. It is a\\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God\\'s love will the rest of life\\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won\\'t\\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses\\' prayer was partially\\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man\\' s highest\\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know, I\\'m a Ford fan, I must say, so I\\'m looking forward to the next\\nMustang.  I have faith that it will be a fine product, more desireable\\nthan the Camaro is now.  You know, that\\'s MHO.  \\n\\nThe differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality,\\njust the philosophy.  It used to be quality _and_ philosophy.  GM is\\nbarely catching up, but they have more room for improvement that\\ncan only be made up in time.  STSs still come off the assembly line\\nwith screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk/door/hood/panel alignments;\\nit\\'s those 75 year old plants.  And the latest GM products still come\\nwith the standard equipment RattleDash (tm).  But like I said, they\\'re\\ngetting better and making the move in the right direction.\\n\\nThey beat Ford to the market with the Camaro/Firebird, but really only\\nin words.  Production of these vehicles will be limited until the\\nend of the year, keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part\\nsince there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there.  I wouldn\\'t\\npress Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it.\\nBesides, no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway.\\n\\nI do not put much stock in the mag rags\\' \"inside\" information, or even\\nFord rep quotes.  The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was\\nfinally disclosed in it\\'s entirety.  \"Inside\" information had the\\nTaurus with a V8 and rear-wheel drive at one point.  I wouldn\\'t look\\nfor a simple re-paneled Mustang, folks; you may be cheating yourself\\nif you do.  There\\'s a lot of potential.  Ford hasn\\'t released a new\\ncar without a 4-wheel IS in 7 years.  The Mustang project has been\\nbrewing for at least 4, right?  A 4-wheel IS could happen.  Those\\nmodular V8\\'s are out there, too.  In the interest of CAFE and\\ncompetition, don\\'t rule those out, either.   Your ignorant if you do.\\nAnd there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there,\\nwho really knows what it\\'ll look like?  The Mach III?  Doubt it.\\nHighly.\\n\\nThe next Mustang will be Ford\\'s highest profile car.  It attracts\\nway more attention than the Camaro/Firebird because it\\'s heritage\\nis more embedded in the general public.  Don\\'t lie to yourself and\\nbelieve Ford will forfeit that.\\n\\nI submit that the Mustang will be a success.  Enough to elicit\\ndefensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here.  You know,\\nintelligent, critical spews like, \"The Mustang bites, man!\"  Some of\\nyou are already beginning.  I predict that the Mustang and Camaro\\nwill be comparable performers, as usual.  I predict that the\\ndifferences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual.\\nThe Camaro is still a huge automobile; the Mustang will retain its\\ncab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase.  The Camaro still\\nreaches out to the fighter pilot, while the Mustang will appeal to\\nthe driver.  The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, while\\nthe Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set.\\nBoth will be more refined (I do think the Camaro is).  There will be\\nno clear winner.\\n\\nUnless the Ford gets the 32v, 300hp Romeo.

Colonial interventions, even in Haiti, haven't worked \\nin the past. They had a 102 coups from 1845-1915. The US invaded in 1915. And left\\nin 1933, almost 17 years after they had intended to. Was it a success? Well,\\nlook at Haiti today and of the past 40 years and decide for yourself. It _was_\\na success so long as the US was in, from what I remember. But it didn't last\\nlong, obviously.\\n\\n\\nNobody did. People should have a right to self-defense. If the UN wants to arm\\nthe Bosnians or Haitian revolutionaries or whoever, I have no problems with\\nthat. I do when they cross that line and attempt to re-arrange boundaries, govts.\\netc., the Vance-Owen plan being one such piece of insanity.\\n \\n\\nWe finally have a clearly-stated point of difference. Colonialism can\\nhave its good side, which is as you stated above - removing thugs from being\\nable to lord it over powerless people.

And I\\'m not constructing a strawman (though it\\'s\\ncertainly possible that I\\'ve misunderstood what you\\'re saying).  However,\\nby any standards, a system that says when A=0, gods are highly unlikely,\\nand when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor, is a system purporting\\nto be an inductive proof that gods either don\\'t exist, or are unnecessary\\nto explain any or all phenomena.  In my experience, systems such as this\\n(including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain\\na fallacy upon close examination.

And those of us who are fighting for the right to life\\nof the preborn, or battling social evils such as pornography or\\ncrime, are beginning to appreciate what an important weapon God\\nhas entrusted to us in the imprecatory Psalms.\\n\\n\\nTHE IMPRECATORY PSALMS\\n\\nEarly in my Christian walk I encountered the prayers for\\njudgement in the Psalms and was quite at loss to know how to\\nrespond to them. Prayers such as:\\n\"Break the arm of the wicked and evil men; call him to account for\\nhis wickedness ...\" Psalm 10:15 did not seem consistent with the\\ngospel of love which I had accepted. Yet Psalm 10:15 was clearly\\nmotivated by love for God (\"The Lord is King for ever and ever;\\nthe nation will perish from His land\" 10:16, and \"Why does the\\nwicked man revile God? 10:13), and by love for the innocent who\\nsuffer (\"You hear, O Lord, the desire of the afflicted; You\\nencourage them, and You listen to their cry, defending the\\nfatherless and oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth,\\nmay terrify no more.\" 10:17-18)\\n\\nNevertheless, I grew increasingly uncomfortable reading such\\ngraphic prayers for God to judge the wicked as: \"Pour out your\\nwrath on them; let Your fierce anger overtake them\" 64:24; \"O\\nLord, the God avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth. Rise up, O\\nJudge of the earth, pay back to the proud what they deserve.\"\\n95:1-2; \"Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; ...let them\\nvanish like water .. let their arrows be blunted ... The\\nrighteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathe\\ntheir feet in the blood of the wicked. Then men will way, \"Surely\\nthe righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who\\njudges the earth.\\'\" 58:6-11\\n\\nCertainly I wanted God to be honoured and yes I was deeply\\ndestressed by the prevalence of evil -  but could I actually pray\\nfor God to \"pour out His wrath\" on the wicked?\\n\\nThe scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to be\\nprayed for own selfish motives, nor against our personal enemies.\\nRather they are to be prayed in Christ, for His glory and against\\nHis enemies. The psalmist describes the targets of these\\nimprecation as: those who devise injustice in their heart and\\nwhose hands mete out violence (58:2) those who \"boast of evil\"\\nand \"are a disgrace in the eyes of God. Your tongue plots\\ndestruction, it is like a sharpened razor, and you who practise\\ndeceit. You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than\\nspeaking the truth.\" 52:1-3; \"They crush your people ... They\\nslay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless.\" 94:5-\\n6; \"With cunning they conspire against Your people; they plot\\nagainst those You cherish.\" 83:3; \"You hate all who do wrong. You\\ndestroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the\\nLord abhors.\" 5:5-6.\\n\\nTo those unrepentant enemies of God the psalmist declares:\\n\"Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin\" 52:5;\\n\"Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies ... of those who\\ngo on in their sins\" 68:21.\\n\\nAnd the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared: \"Then\\nit will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules ...\"\\n59:13; \"to proclaim the powers of God\" 68:34; \"All kings will bow\\ndown to Him and all nations will serve Him \" 72:11; \"Who knows\\nthe power of Your anger? For Your wrath is as great as the fear\\nthat is due You. \" 90:11\\n\\nYet despite the fact that 90 of the 150 Psalms include\\nimprecations (prayers invoking God\\'s righteous judgement upon the\\nwicked) such prayers are rare in the average Western church.\\nHowever, amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are much\\nmore common.\\n\\n\\nPRAYING AGAINST THE PERSECUTORS\\n\\nAmidst the burnt out churches and devastation of Marxist Angola I\\nfound the survivors of communist persecution including the\\ncrippled and maimed, and widows and orphans praying for God to\\nstrike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the Church.\\nI was shocked - yet it was Biblical (Even the martyrs in heaven\\npray \"How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge\\nthe inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?\" Revelation\\n6:10).\\n\\nThe initiator of the communist persecution in Angola was Agestino\\nNeto. Described as a \"drunken, psychotic, marxist poet\", Neto had\\nbeen installed by Cuban troops as the first dictator of Angola.\\nHe boasted that: \"Within 20 years there won\\'t be a Bible or a\\nchurch left in Angola. I will have eradicated Christianity.\" Yet\\ndespite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it is\\nnot Christianity that was eradicated in Angola but Agestino Neto.\\nNeto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table in\\nMoscow.\\n\\nIn Romania I learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recorded\\nof God judging the persecutors of the Church in answer to prayer:\\n  *  A communist official ordered a certain pastor to be\\n     arrested. the next day the official died of a heart attack.\\n  *  Another communist party official ordered that all the Bibles\\n     in his district were to be collected and pulped, to be\\n     turned into toilet paper. This blasphemous project was in\\n     fact carried out. But the next day when the official was\\n     medically examined, he was informed that he had terminal\\n     cancer. He died shortly afterwards.\\n  *  On another occasion, a communist official who had ordered a\\n     Baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car\\n     crash the very next day.\\n  *  When an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on\\n     the mountainside in a forest, the workmen flatly refused to\\n     carry out the order. At gunpoint a group of conscripted\\n     gypsies also refused to touch the church. In desperation,\\n     the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet-point to\\n     dismantle the structure. Yet the officer in charge pleaded\\n     with the local Christians to pray for him, that God would\\n     not judge him. He emphasised that he had nothing against\\n     Christians and was only obeying strict orders. The building\\n     was in fact reconstructed later, and again used for worship.\\n     \"They were all seized with Sear and the Name of the Lord\\n     Jesus was held in high honour... in this way the Word of the\\n     Lord spread widely and grew in power. \" Acts 19:17,20\\n\\nNicolae Ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of the\\npersecution in Romania was overthrown by his own army and\\nexecuted on Christmas day, 1989, to joyous shouts of \"the\\nantiChrist is dead\" in the streets. Many testified that this was\\nin answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people of\\nRomania.\\n\\nAnother persecutor of the Church who challenged God was Samora\\nMachel, the first dictator of Marxist Mozambique. Samora Machel\\nwas a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies in\\nthe 1960\\'s. He pledged his soul to Satan and vowed that he would\\ndestroy the Church and turn Mozambique into the first truly\\nMarxist-Leninist state in Africa. Thousands of churches in\\nMozambique were closed confiscated, \"nationalised\" chained and\\npadlocked, burnt down or boarded up. Missionaries were expelled,\\nsome being imprisoned first. Evangelism was forbidden. Bibles\\nwere ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of Christians,\\nincluding many pastors and elders, were shipped off to\\nconcentration camps - most were never seen again.\\n\\nA month before his sudden death Samora Machel cursed God publicly\\nand challenged Him to prove His existence by striking him\\n(Machel) dead. On 19 October 1986, while several churches were\\nspecifically praying for God to stop the persecution in\\nMozambique, Machel\\'s Soviet Tupelov aircraft crashed in a violent\\nthunderstorm. The plane crashed 200 metres within South Africa\\'s\\nboundary with Mozambique. Amidst the wreckage the marxist plans\\nfor overthrowing the government of Malawi were discovered and\\npublished. Not only had God judged a blasphemer and a persecutor,\\nbut He had also saved a country from persecution.\\n\\nIn the months leading up to the first multi-party elections in\\nZambia many churches fasted and prayed tor God to remove the 27\\nyear socialist dictatorship of Kenneth Kaunda. This was done on\\n31st October 1991 when Fredrick Chiluba (a man converted to\\nChrist whilst imprisoned for opposing Kaunda) was elected\\npresident of Zambia and covenanted to make Zambia a Christian\\ncountry.\\n\\nIt is recorded in history that the wicked Mary, Queen of Scots,\\ndeclared trembling and in tears: \"I am more afraid of John Knox\\'s\\nprayers than of an army of ten thousand\".\\n\\nOn 3 April 1993 the Secretary General of the South African\\nCommunist Party Chris Hani was shot dead. From the unprecedented\\ninternational wave of condolences and adulation reported one\\ncould be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and a\\nmartyr. Certainly it was not the death and resurrection of Christ\\nJesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of South Africa\\nthis Easter, but the assassination of Chris Hani.\\n\\nThe stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that 20 135 people\\nwere murdered in South Africa in 1992, yet more collective\\nconcern and anguish were reported over the death of the head of\\nthe SA Communist Party than for all the thousands of other\\nvictims. Indeed the SA government, the international community\\nand the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reported\\nover this one death than for all the 50 000 South Africans\\nmurdered since 2nd February 1990 when the ANC, SACP and PAC were\\nunbanned!\\n\\nYet as a member of the ANC Revolutionary Council since 1973,\\nDeputy Commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) the ANC\\'s \"military\\nwing\" - from 1982, and Chief of Staff of MK from 1987, Chris Hani\\nhad approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of many\\nunarmed civilians. As Jesus warned: \"all who live by the sword\\nwill die by the sword \" Matt 26:52.\\n\\nAfter personally confronting Hani about his terrorist activities\\nat a press conference in Washington DC (where he publicly\\ndeclared his support for Fidel Castro, Col. Gaddafi, Yasser\\nArafat and Saddam Hussein and defended the placing of car bombs\\nand limpet mines in public places during \"the struggle\") I told\\nhim that I was a Christian and, while I didn\\'t hate him, I did\\nhate communism and I was praying for him - that God would either\\nbring him to repentance and salvation in Christ, or that God\\nwould remove him. He responded by swearing and declaring that he\\nwas an atheist.\\n\\nSeveral other people also prayed that God would either bring Hani\\nto repentance or remove him. Similarly several churches in\\nAmerica have begun to pray the imprecatory Psalms against\\nunrepentant abortionists. In one town 8 abortionists were struck\\ndown, with heart attacks, strokes, car accidents and cancer,\\nwithin months of these public prayers for God to stop these\\nkillers of preborn babies.\\n\\nSome praised God for His righteous acts of judgement and quoted:\\n\"When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous and terror\\nto evildoers \" Proverbs 21:15. Others were shocked that any\\nChristian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any -\\neven of the blatantly wicked. Yet the Apostles prayed imprecatory\\nprayers (Acts 13:8-12; Galatians 1:8-9; 2 Tim 4:14-15) and so did\\nour Lord (Matt 11:20-24).\\n\\nWhat then should our attitude towards the imprecatory Psalms be?\\nShould we be praying the Psalms? To tackle these thorny issues I\\nwould like to present a short summary of an excellent book, \"War\\nPsalms of the Prince of Peace - Lessons From The Imprecatory\\nPsalms\" by James E Adams, (published by the Presbyterian and\\nReformed Publishing Company):\\n\\nOur Lord Jesus Christ & His apostles used the Psalms constantly\\nin teaching men to know God. The New Testament (NT) quotes the\\nOld Testament (OT) over 283 times. 41% of all OT quotes in the NT\\nare from the Psalms. Christ Himself alluded to the Psalms over 50\\ntimes. The Psalms are the Prayer Book of the Bible.\\n\\n\\n1. Are the imprecatory Psalms the oracles of God?\\n\\nSome Christian commentators & theologians reject these Psalms as\\n\"devilish\", \"diabolical \", \"unsuited to the church\", and \"Not God\\n\\'s pronouncements of His wrath on the wicked; but the prayers of\\na man for vengeance on his enemies, just the opposite of Jesus\\'\\nteaching that we should love our enemies. \"\\n\\nYet 2 Tim 3:16-17 declares:\\n\"All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching,\\nrebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the\\nman of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. \"\\n(see also 2 Peter 3:15-16).\\n\\nThe fact that something in the Word of God is beyond our\\ncomprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning its\\ninspiration. To make ourselves the judge of what is good or evil\\nis to impudently take the place of God.\\n\\nDo we imagine ourselves to be holier than God? Wrong ideas of God\\nhave led many to become \"evangelic plastic surgeons who have made\\nit their job to \"clean up\" God\\'s Word according to their own\\nideas of what is proper. They have forgotten that it is God alone\\nwho must determine what Christianity is and what is suitable for\\nHis Church. The essence of what many have done is to question the\\nauthority of God\\'s Word (like Eve\\'s original sin of listening to\\nSatan\\'s question \"Yes, hath God said... ?\").\\n\\nThe Psalms are part of God\\'s revelation of Himself and His\\nattributes, and they are reaffirmed by the NT as the\\nauthoritative Word of God. Those imprecatory Psalms which these\\nevangelical plastic surgeons reject as \"unsuited\" and \"unworthy\"\\nfor the Church are the very Psalms Christ used to testify about\\nHimself (eg: Mark 12:36; Matt 22:43-44) and which the Apostles\\nused as authoritative Scripture (eg: Acts 1:16-20; Acts 4:25; Heb\\n4:7). See also: 2 Samuel 23:1-2.\\n\\nCH Spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory Psalms, (especially\\nPs 109):\\n\"Truly this is one of the hard places of Scripture, a passage\\nwhich the soul trembles to read, yet it is not ours to sit in\\njudgement upon it, but to bow our ear to what the Lord would\\nspeak to us therein. \"\\n\\nThe rejection of any part of God\\'s Word is a rejection of the\\ngiver of that Word, God Himself.\\n\\n\\n2. Who is praying these Psalms?\\n\\nChrist quoted the Psalms not merely as prophesy; He actually\\nspoke the Psalms as His own words. The Psalms occupied an\\nenormous place in the life of our Lord. He used it as His prayer\\nbook and song book - from the Synagogue to the festivals and at\\nthe Last Supper.\\n\\nOn the cross Christ quoted from the Psalms - not as some ancient\\nauthority that He adapted for His own use, but as His very own\\nwords - the words of the Lord\\'s Anointed - which as David\\'s Son\\nHe truly was.\\n\"Father, into your hands I commit my Spirit\" Ps 31:5\\n\"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" Ps 22:1\\n\\nIn His ministry Christ foretells what He will say as the Judge on\\nthe day of judgement, and He quotes the Psalms in doing so!\\nMatt 7:23 \"Then I will tell them plainly, \\'I never knew you. Away\\nfrom me, you evildoers\\'. \" Ps 6:8\\n\\nIn Heb 10:5 the apostle attributes Ps 40:6-8 directly to Christ\\nalthough nowhere in the Gospels is Christ recorded as having said\\nthese words. Similarly Hebrews 2 : 12 attributes Ps 22:22\\ndirectly to Christ despite there being no record of His having\\nspoken these words while on earth. Clearly the apostles believed\\nChrist is speaking in the Psalms.\\n\\nChrist came to establish His kingdom and to extend His mercy in\\nall the earth. But let us never forget that Jesus will come again\\nto execute Judgement on the wicked.\\nDavid as the anointed king of the chosen people of God was a\\nprototype of Jesus Christ. Acts 2:30:\\n\"being therefore a prophet, ... he foresaw and spoke of the\\nresurrection of Christ. \"\\nDavid was a witness to Christ in his office, in his lite, and in\\nhis words. The same words which David spoke, the future Messiah\\nspoke through him. The prayers of David were prayed also by\\nChrist. Or better Christ Himself prayed these Psalms through His\\nforerunner David.\\n\\nThe imprecatory Psalms are expressions of the infinite justice of\\nGod, of His indignation against wrong doing, and His compassion\\nfor the wronged.\\n\\n\\n3. But what about the Psalms of repentance?\\n\\nChrist is also the Lamb of God, the substitutionary sacrifice for\\nour sins. Christ in the day of His crucifixion was charged with\\nthe sin of His people. He appropriated to Himself those debts for\\nwhich He had made Himself responsible. Our Lord was the\\nsubstitution for the sinner. He took the sinners place (Isaiah\\n53).\\n\\n\"God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we\\nmight become the righteousness of God. \" 2 Cor 5:21\\n\\nIn history the Psalms, especially the imprecatory Psalms, have\\nbeen understood to have been the prayers of Christ by: St\\nAugustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Tertullian, Luther and many others.\\nAll the Psalms are the voice of Christ. Christ is praying the\\nimprecatory Psalms! All the Psalms are messianic. It is the Lord\\nJesus Christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance. It is\\nonly right for the righteous King of Peace to ask God to destroy\\nHis enemies.\\n\\nThese prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies of\\nKing Jesus. His prayers will be answered! God\\'s Word is revealed\\nupon all who oppose Christ. Anyone who rejects God\\'s way of\\nforgiveness in the cross of Christ will bear the dreadful curses\\nof God.\\n\\nHe who prays Psalm 69:23-28 will one day make this prayer a\\nreality when He declares to those on His left:\\n\"Depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared\\nfor the devil and his angels. \" Matt 25:41\\n\\nAll the enemies of the Lord need to hear these Psalms. *God\\'s\\nKingdom is at War.* The powers of evil will tall and God alone\\nwill reign forever!\\n\"With justice He judges and makes war...out of His mouth comes a\\nsharp sword with which to strike down the nations. He will rule\\nthem with an iron sceptre; He treads the winepress of the fury of\\nthe wrath of God Almighty...King of Kings and Lord of Lords. \"\\nRev 19 : 15\\n\\n\\n4. Are Jesus\\' prayers contradictory?\\n\\nWhat about Jesus\\' command to love our enemies and to bless those\\nwho curse us (Matt 5:44)?\\n\\nChrist is of course the loving and merciful Saviour who forgives\\nsin; but He is also the awesome Judge who is coming in Judgement\\non those who disobey His Gospel.\\n\\n\"God is just. He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you\\nand give relief to you who are troubled...This will happen when\\nthe Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with His\\npowerful angels. He will punish those who do not obey the Gospel\\nof our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting\\ndestruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from\\nthe majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified in\\nHis holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who have\\nbelieved. \" 2 Thess 1:6-10\\n\\nJesus has power on earth to forgive sins, and He has power on\\nearth to execute judgement upon His enemies. In the Psalms we see\\nboth the vengeance and the love ot God.\\n\\nEven in the N.T. & in the Gospels we see imprecations.\\n\"Woe to you,...hypocrites...blind guides...blind fools...full of\\ngreed and self indulgence...whitewashed tombs...you snakes! You\\nbrood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to Hell ? \"\\nMatt 23\\n\\nIn Matt 26:23-24 Christ quotes from Ps 69 and 109 to refer to His\\nbetrayal by Judas.\\n\\nWe also need to acknowledge that Christ\\'s prayers of blessing are\\nnot for all. In John 17:6-9 it is clear that Christ is only\\npraying to the elect of God - those who have:\\n\"obeyed your Word\"... \"accepted\" God\\'s Word ... and have\\n\"believed \". (see Luke 10:8-16 - Those who reject the\\nmessage of God\\'s kingdom will be judged.)\\n\\n\\n5. May we pray the imprecatory Psalms?\\n\\nMartin Luther pointed out that when one prays: \"Hallowed be Thy\\nName, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done \" then \"he must put all\\nthe opposition to this in one pile and say: \\'Curses, maledictions\\nand disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom. May\\nthey be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes and\\nwisdom and plans run aground\\' . \"\\n\\nTo pray tor the extension of God\\'s kingdom is to solicit the\\ndestruction of all other kingdoms, eg: Dan 2:44: \"The God of\\nheaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ... it\\nwill crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it\\nwill itself endure forever. \"\\n\\n* Advance and victory for the Church means defeat and retreat for\\nthe kingdom of darkness. *\\n\\nThere is a life & death struggle between two kingdoms. The Church\\ncannot exclude hatred tor satan\\'s kingdom from its love for God\\'s\\nkingdom. God\\'s kingdom cannot come without satan\\'s kingdom being\\ndestroyed. God\\'s will cannot be done on earth without the\\ndestruction of evil. The glory of God demands the destruction of\\nevil. Instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalism\\nwhich insists upon the assumed, but really non-existent, rights\\nof man - we should focus instead upon the rights of God.\\n\\nNote Psalm 83 where the Psalmist prays against those who \"plot\\ntogether\" against God and His people:\\n\"Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your Name O\\nLord... Do to them as You did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and\\nJabin at the river Kishon, who perished at Endor and became like\\nrefuse on the ground. \"\\n\\nThe story of Sisera in the book of Judges (Chapter 4 and 5)\\nprovides a vivid example of God\\'s judgement on the wicked. Sisera\\n\"cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years\" and they\\n\"cried to the Lord for help\" Judges 4:3. In response to those\\nprayers: \"The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by\\nthe sword, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot...\\nAll the troops of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left. \"\\nJudges 4:15-16\\n\\nThe account then goes on to describe how Sisera escaped to the\\ntent of Jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safety\\nand then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer. The\\nsong of victory by Deborah and Barak celebrated the crushing of\\nthe head of Sisera in graphic detail (Judges 5:25-27). And it is\\nthis that Psalm 83 implores God to again do to His enemies.. \"As\\nyou did to Sisera ...\"\\n\\n\\n6. The blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience\\n\\nThe imprecatory Psalms are fully consistent with the Law of God:\\n     \"If you do not carefully follow all the words of this Law,\\n     which are written in this book, and do not revere this\\n     glorious and awesome Name - the Lord your God - the Lord\\n     will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants. He\\n     will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you\\n     dreaded, and they will cling to you. The Lord will also\\n     bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not\\n     recorded in this Book of the Law until you are\\n     destroyed...because you did not obey the Lord your God ...\\n     so it will please Him to ruin and destroy you. You will be\\n     uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. \"\\n     Deuteronomy 28:58-63\\n\\nThe covenant God made with His people included curses for\\ndisobedience as well as blessings for obedience. Deuteronomy 27\\nrecords the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms in\\nan awesome account:\\n\"The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud\\nvoice:\\n\"Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol - a thing\\ndetestable to the Lord, the work of the craftsman\\'s hands - and\\nsets it up in secret. \"\\nThen all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" \"\\n\"Cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother...\\n\"Cursed is the man who moves his neighbour\\'s boundary stone...\\n\"Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads...\\n\"Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, the\\nfatherless or the widow...\\n\"Cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly...\\n\"Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent\\nperson.\\n\"Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the Law by\\ncarrying them out.\\nThen all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" \" Deut 27:14-26\\n\\nThe New Testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of\\nrejecting Christ is the curse. \"If anyone does not love the\\nLord - a curse be on him. \" 1 Corinthians 16:22\\n\\n(See also: Romans 12:19-21; Hebrews 1:1-3; 3:7-12; 3:1519; 10:26-\\n31; 12:14-29.)\\n\\n\\n7. How can we preach these prayers?\\n\\nThe Church of Jesus Christ is an army under orders.\\nScripture constitutes the official dispatch from the Commander-\\nin-Chief. But we have a problem: those who are called to pass on\\nthose orders to others are refusing to do so. How then can we\\nexpect to be a united, effective army? Is it any wonder that the\\ntroops have lost sight of their commission to demolish the\\nstrongholds of the kingdom of darkness? If the Church does not\\nhear the battle cries of her Captain, how will she follow Him\\nonto the battlefield?\\n\\nPastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the Church\\'s\\nCommander, never withholding or changing His words. One whose job\\nis to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certain\\nand severe punishment if he dared to amend the general\\'s orders.\\nThe pastor\\'s charge is of greater importance than that of a\\ncourier in any earthly army. There\\'s no place tor the dispatcher\\nto decide he doesn\\'t agree with his Commander\\'s strategy.\\n\\nWhen Jesus Christ sent seventy-two disciples on a preaching\\nmission, He told them to proclaim the coming of God\\'s Kingdom (Lk\\n10:9) - that is, to announce that people must submit to God\\'s\\nrule in their lives. Jesus instructed them to pray for peace on\\nany house they approach, assuring them that if anyone rejected\\nit, the peace would return on the disciples (verse 5). But we\\nmust consider what He said they should do if their message were\\nrejected - that is, if the hearers persisted in rebellion against\\nGod\\'s rule - \"But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go\\ninto its \\'streets and say, \\'Even the dust of your town that\\nsticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this:\\nThe kingdom of God is near\"\\' Luke 10:11.\\n\\nWhat would be the result of that denunciation? I tell you, it\\nwill be more bearable on that day for Sodom [on which God sent\\nfire from Heaven in judgement for its wickedness] than for that\\ntown (verse 12). Immediately Jesus added curses on Korazin,\\nBethsaida, and Capernaum tor their rejection of His message\\n(verses 13-15). He then explained to the disciples the great\\nauthority He had given them: \"He who listens to you listens to\\nMe; he who rejects you rejects Me; but he who rejects Me rejects\\nhim who sent Me \" (verse 16). This is the fundamental basis tor\\ncalling down God\\'s curses on anyone: his persistent rebellion\\nagainst God\\'s authority expressed in His Law and the ministry of\\nHis servants.\\n\\nWe need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of the\\nPrince of Peace. Only then will the Church awake from its\\nlethargy and once again enter the battle. If we tail to pass on\\nthe battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the ranks\\nwill be inevitable.\\n\\nLike Psalm 1 our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings of\\nobedience and the curse of disobedience. The eternal truth is\\nthat God cannot be mocked. Whatever a man sows - that shall he\\nreap (Galatians 6:7). The curses pronounced on disobedience in\\nDeut 28:47-53 were fulfilled in detail in Samaria (2 Kings\\n6:2&29) and in Judea (AD 70). The wrath of God upon covenant\\nbreakers is real.\\n\\nThe \"I\" of the Psalms is Jesus Christ. The \"we\" of the Psalms\\nincludes those of us in the Lord Jesus. The enemies are not our\\nown, individually, but those of the Lord and of His Church. The\\nPsalms are ot Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King. They record\\nChrist\\'s march in victory against the kingdom of darkness. As\\nChrist is the author of the Psalms, so, too, is He the final\\nfulfilment of the covenant on which they are based. God will\\nanswer the psalmist\\'s prayers completely in Jesus Christ on the\\nfinal day of judgment. While on earth Jesus foretold the day when\\nHe will say: \"But those enemies of Mine who did not want Me to be\\nKing over them - bring them here and kill them in front of Me\"\\nLuke 19:27.\\n\\nA fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and to\\nobey Jesus as King and Lord. Hearing expositions of these war\\npsalms of the Prince of Peace will remind His people that God\\'s\\nkingdom is at war! The kingdom of darkness is being overcome by\\nthe kingdom of Jesus Christ, a war in which each local\\ncongregation of believers plays a vital part. You must rally your\\nbattalion to put on the whole armour of God, including \"the sword\\nof the Spirit, which is the Word of God \" Eph 6:17. That battle-\\nreadiness also involves \"pray(ing) in the Spirit on all occasions\\nwith all kinds of prayers and requests n Eph 6:18.\\n\\nChrist teaches His army to pray for the utter destruction of the\\nenemies of God as the psalmist did: \"Pour out Your wrath on the\\nnations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that do not\\ncall on Your Name\" Ps 79:6.\\n\\nTo deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world it\\nis necessary for us to pray for God\\'s justice. Those who are\\npersecuted need the comfort of these prayers.\\n\\n\"Let the saints rejoice in His honour and sing for joy...May the\\npraise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in\\ntheir hands, to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment\\non the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles\\nwith shackles of iron, to carry out the sentences written against\\nthem. This is the glory of all His saints. Praise the Lord. \" Ps\\n149:5-9\\n\\nPrayer is, in fact, spiritual warfare. One weapon is prayer for\\nconversion of spiritual enemies; another is prayer for judgement\\non those who finally refuse to be converted. We handicap the army\\nof God when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that He\\nhas given us. It is at all times a part of the task of the people\\nnf God to destroy evil.\\n\\nIf you have been guilty of dulling your sword, by neglecting or\\nundermining these psalms, repent of that sin, sharpen your sword\\nanew, and go forth to do battle in the Name and for the Glory of\\nJesus - until \"the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth as\\nthe waters cover the sea\" Hab 2:14.\\n\\nThe full book \"War Psalms of the Prince of Peace \" is available,\\nat R25, from Frontline Fellowship, PO Box 74 Newlands, 7725 RSA.\\n',\n",

After WWI, many Bosnian Muslims were\\nkilled and their land taken over by Serbs, and the motive was plunder,\\nnot some fictitious \"supression of rebellion.\"  Even earlier, one can\\npoint to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of\\nMuslims.  Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic, political adviser to the\\nSerbian monarchic regime, says in his memorandum \"The Expulsion of the\\nArnauts\" which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic\\non March 7, 1937, in Belgrade:\\n\\n   The Mode of Removal\\n   -------------------\\n\\n   [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed\\n   through state terror and \"private initiative\", i.e. Chetnik plunder: ]\\n\\n   Private initiative, too, can assist greatly in this direction.  We should\\n   distribute weapons to our colonists, as need be.  The old forms of Chetnik\\n   action should be organized and secretly assisted.  [...]\\n   ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and,\\n   if need be, ascribed to economic reasons.  Finally, local riots can be\\n   incited.  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the\\n   Chetniks, rather than the army.\\n\\n   There remains one more means, WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL\\n   EFFECT AFTER 1878, that is, by secretly burning down Albanian villages\\n   and city quarters.\\n\\n(Emphasis above is mine.)  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually\\nall Muslims during late 19th century.  This policy of state terrorism\\nagainst Muslims, aided by Chetnik \"private initiative,\" has continued in WWII\\nand today.  For example, Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book \"Od tradicije do \\nidentiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana\" (Sarajevo:\\nSvjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca\\nin WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot, explaining\\ntheir action as follows:\\n\\n   \"Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you\\n   are a Turk [i.e. Muslim].  And since you helped us, we shall not\\n   torture you.\"\\n\\nso the shot him instead of cutting his throat.  In the past year, Serbs\\nhave repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca.  Destruction\\nof mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes the\\neradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich part do you claim is untrue?  Explain yourself, or withdraw your claim.\\n\\n\\nCroatia never had many Muslim citizens for historical reasons, because it\\nwas not a part of the Ottoman Empire.  The last major battles between\\nAustro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the\\nend of the 17th century.  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism\\ncame into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic, who saw Bosnian Muslims as the\\nbest Croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations \\nto Sarajevo?  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian\\nnationalism here.   Political nationalism has always been stronger.  As\\nfor your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim\\nalliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble.  Arguments such as\\nyours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split.  \\n\\n\\nIn international relations 101 you\\'ll learn that unless weak unite to\\ncounterbalance the strong player, soon they are taken over and that\\'s the\\nend of them.  Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats\\nand Bosnian Muslims.  This is only natural; all other alignments are\\nunstable.  I\\'m working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats and\\nMuslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed.  \\nYou are wrong if you think only \"image\" is at stake here.  Croatia has\\na deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims, and vice versa.  \\n\\nI think Tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice \\nat this point.  Tensions should have been defused better earlier, before \\nany open confrontation developed.  Although I still think Croatia will\\nsurvive, it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse\\noff.  However, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not\\nsee it getting any worse.  The key point is: do they still have any hope left?\\nIf not, then all bets are off.\\n\\nMr. Stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this.

Both  families  agreed in  condemning  the Eutychian heresy. Both  families\\nconfess that the Logos, the Second Person  of the Holy  Trinity, only begotten\\nof the Father before the ages  and consubstantial with  Him, was incarnate and\\nwas born from the Virgin Mary Theotokos; fully consubstantial with us, perfect\\nman with soul, body and mind  ($  \\\\nu o  \\\\upsilon \\\\zeta $); He  was crucified,\\ndied, was  buried and rose  from the dead on  the third day, ascended   to the\\nHeavenly Father, where He sits on the right hand of the Father as  Lord of all\\ncreation. At  Pentecost, by the coming of  the  Holy Spirit He  manifested the\\nChurch as His Body. We look forward to His coming again in the fullness of His\\nglory, according to the Scriptures.\\n\\n2. Both  families condemn the  Nestorian heresy and the crypto-Nestorianism of\\nTheodoret of  Cyrus. They agree that it  is not sufficient merely  to say that\\nChrist is consubstantial both with His Father  and with us, by  nature God and\\nby nature man; it is necessary to affirm also that the Logos, Who is by nature\\nGod,  became by  nature   man, by His  incarnation  in the fullness  of  time.\\n\\n3. Both families agree  that the Hypostasis of the  Logos became  composite by\\nuniting to His divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy, which\\nHe has  in common with  the Father and  the Holy Spirit, created human nature,\\nwhich He assumed  at the Incarnation  and made  His own, with its natural will\\nand energy.\\n\\n4. Both families agree  that the natures  with their proper energies and wills\\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nare united hypostatically and  naturally   without confusion, without  change,\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nwithout  division and without separation,  and that they are distinguished  in\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nthought alone.\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n5.

In order to bring out the problems most clearly, I\\'ll\\nalso stipulate (what I think is far less plausible) that Paul coined the\\nterm for this usage.  The question I want to turn to is what that would\\nmean for Paul\\'s readers and for later Christians.  This should be shorter\\nthan my last note, as we will see that this question rapidly confronts us\\nwith some of the major divisions within Christ\\'s body, and I am not trying\\nto open the gates for flames across any of the terrible chasms that\\nseparate any of us from our fellow Christians.  My own biases (loosely\\ncharacterizable as \"liberal\") will be evident, but I am not grinding an\\naxe here, so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be HARD\\nto reach \"closure\" when the issues involved strike at the heart of what we\\neach, in our own different ways, see as crucial to the Gospel of Christ.\\n\\nSo; stipulating Paul\\'s intent, the immediate question is: HOW CAN HIS\\nREADERS UNDERSTAND this intent?  And following on that question, there is\\na second one: WHAT IS OUR PROPER ACTION if we *do* manage to understand him?\\n\\nSince Paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of 1st\\nCorinthians, there are two \"positive\" answers and one \"negative\" to this\\nquestion:\\n\\n+\\ta.  Paul (or Apollos, or someone) in the apostolic community has\\n\\t    conveyed to the Corinthians the then-traditional Jewish condem-\\n\\t    nation of homosexual behavior, and Paul expects them to be\\n\\t    sufficiently well-tutored by this tradition that he needs no\\n\\t    futher explanation.  [I should note that there is no evidence\\n\\t    in the letter, or in 2 Corinthians for such a supposition :-)]\\n\\n+\\tb.  The Spirit will teach us what Paul means (or, if not Paul,\\n\\t    what God means \"behind\" Paul\\'s inspired word-choice.)\\n\\n-\\tc.  We *don\\'t* know, and cannot guess to within any better pre-\\n\\t    cision here than, for comparison, in the parallel use by Paul,\\n\\t    in the same passage of the word  _pleonektai_ (\"those who have\\n\\t    more\" -- if you think that _areseonkoitai_ is \"obvious\" from\\n\\t    its roots, try cutting your teeth on *this* word!  The NEB\\n\\t    translates it as \"grabbers\") or even _methusoi_ (\"drunkards\"\\n\\t    -- at least this has the advantage of being a common insult,\\n\\t    so that at least there is *some* hint as to its meaning!)\\n\\nThe three positions more or less -- if I can be allowed some exaggeration\\nfor the sake of argument -- define a classical Catholic attitude towards\\ntradition, one form of Protestant _sola scriptura_, and a liberal/critical\\ndemand for evidence.  All three positions have strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n_ad_ a:\\tIt is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the\\n\\tcommunity of Christ\\'s disciples and their successors, and that\\n\\tour NT scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition.\\n\\tBut it\\'s also the case that we know little or nothing about this\\n\\ttradition until almost a century after Paul, which is to say that\\n\\twe have access to the tradition only after several generations of\\n\\tpossibly confused transmission.  The scripture is itself our only\\n\\tdocumentation of the tradition in the critical era.\\n\\n_ad_ b:\\tIf we are NOT born of water and Spirit [to revert to John in an\\n\\tattempt to explain Paul :-)], then we have no more hope of under-\\n\\tstanding the gospel than Nicodemus had; neither the traditions of\\n\\tmen nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the Spirit\\n\\tfrom blowing where it will -- the Paraclete is a kamikaze.  But\\n\\tthe downside of Protestant belief in the efficacy of the Spirit\\n\\tas our guide in scripture is that the wing of Protestantism that\\n\\ttakes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent\\n\\tunderstanding supposedly derived from the \"clear\" Word of God.\\n\\n\\t\\t[Note: classical Lutheran, Calvinist and Anglican thought\\n\\t\\tconstrains scripture to be read *within* tradition, even\\n\\t\\twhile reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture;\\n\\t\\tthe more bizarre forms of \"I will read Scripture my way\"\\n\\t\\tare primarily a fringe aspect of \"cultic\" Protestantism.]\\n\\n\\tThe main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no\\n\\tmeans for ONE person to convey to another what that one may feel\\n\\t*is* teaching received from the Spirit; and history shows incredible\\n\\tconflict between Christians on this point, each in his own mind\\n\\t\"convinced\" that he is led by the Spirit.  No one can seriously\\n\\turge point b without SOME sense of its potential for setting Christian\\n\\tagainst Christian.  To what purpose?\\n\\n_ad_ c:\\tThe critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can\\n\\treach a conclusion, it can lay out the data in a way which is open\\n\\tto all.  The weakness is an obvious corollary: this is not usually\\n\\tpossible. :-)\\n\\n\\t[If I may say a word here, out of my own already acknowledged bias;\\n\\tone complaint against critical methodology is that it \"dissolves\"\\n\\tfaith -- but surely a \"faith\" that cannot honestly face the evalu-\\n\\tation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to\\n\\taddress.]\\n\\nAnyway, there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between\\n\"liberal\" and \"conservative\" positions, mostly on the basis of extreme\\nzealots of positions b and c.  A Catholic sense of authority and tradition\\ntends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position, so that\\ndespite horrendous strains Rome is NOT as likely to find these issues as\\nultimately divisive as the Protestant world will.  And Anglicans will (I\\npredict) muddle through on the _via media_, attempting to give each position\\nits due, but no more than its due. \\n\\nSecond question.  Suppose tradition tells us, and lots of \"spiritual\"\\nChristians tell us, and critical thought at least admits as possible,\\nthat Paul is refering to a flat, universal Levitical prohibition against\\nmale-male sex.  What then?  Again, we can abdicate our personal responsi-\\nbility to tradition, and let it dictate the answer.  But it\\'s precisely\\nwhere inherited traditions are NOT questioned that they\\'re most dangerous.\\n\\nWe have EXAMPLES of Christ questioning the Pharisees and THEIR use of\\ntradition (despite his urging, in Matthew 23:2 that we are to heed them).\\nWe have EXAMPLES of Peter, and more radically still Paul, jettisoning the\\ntraditions that THEY were led by the Spirit to call into question.  Jesus\\nand Peter and Paul do not so much \"throw out\" tradition as subject it to\\nradical criticism, on a couple of very basic grounds:\\n\\n     \"the weightier demands of the law: justice and mercy and good faith\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(Matthew 23:23)\\nand  \"On these two commandments [love God & neighbor] hand the whole Law,\\n      and the Prophets, also.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(Matthew 22:40)\\n\\nIf there is a fundamental (because derived from Christ) validity in the\\nchallenge to *some* traditions, a validity that led the first generation\\nto go so far as to waive application of the Torah to gentile converts\\n(vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from Jesus\\' reported\\nwords and deeds), it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination\\nto *postulate* that *only* the traditions that we have specific challenges\\nagainst are in fact open to challenge.\\n\\nAll traditions passed *through* men are traditions *of* men.  That God may\\nlead us even so, that these traditions are a source of our spiritual\\ninstruction I will freely grant.  But tradition is inherently human, and\\ninherently corruptible (and given the Fall, corrupt).  Nothing in it is\\nimmune to challenge, when the Spirit shows us a failure in justice, mercy\\nand good faith.  Nothing may ultimately stand unless it DOES follow from\\nlove of God and love of neighbor.\\n\\nI am perfectly willing to grant that I could be blind to my own sin.  That\\nthe Spirit may have taught another what She refuses to teach me (or I am\\ntoo dense to learn).  That tradition *might* have value here.  But what I\\n*know* of tradition is that on one occasion, some superstitious Christians\\nappealed to Justinian after an earthquake in Asia Minor, and scapegoated\\n\"sodomites\" as the \"cause\" of the earthquake, so that legislation was\\npassed making homosexual behavior a capital offense.  If that is in\\naccord with the gospel of Christ, then I am no Christian.  That is human\\ntradition at its most hateful and vicious.  And I see nothing all that much\\ndifferent in all the unbidden eruptions onto USENET of people who are quick\\nto condemn but slow to understand.  If that is the leading of the Spirit,\\nthen I want no part of it.  But what I have found in obedience to the Lord\\nis that I am, myself, TOTALLY dependent on the witness of other Christians,\\nfor the truth that lives in the Body of Christ.\\n\\nAnd I say to all who doubt that gay Christianity is from God what Gamaliel\\nsaid to doubting Pharisees who would have suppressed the earliest Church:\\n\\n\\t\"be careful how you deal with these people...  If this enterprise,\\n\\tthis movement of theirs, is of human origin it will break up of\\n\\tits own accord; but if it does in fact come from God you will not\\n\\tonly be unable to destroy them, but you might find yourselves\\n\\tfighting against God.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t[Acts 5:36...39] \\n\\nAll I ask is that you listen to your traditions, and read your scriptures\\nwith a mind and soul OPEN to the Spirit, and to the past history of our\\nfirst Christian witnesses\\' willingness to challenge tradition and OTHER\\nreadings of scripture -- though read with all the authority of scribes and\\nrabbis -- and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the\\nlove of God and neighbor.  Then, study the evidence; learn the history of\\nChristians oppressing Christians out of their traditions and eagerness to\\njudge where Jesus and Paul tell us NOT to judge.  And let the witness of\\nthe Spirit in the lives of your fellow Christians -- including those who\\nare NOT of your preference in theology -- guide you towards God\\'s truth.\\n-- \\nMichael L.

I think\\nthere are two ways to use tradition.  One is to say that when Paul and\\nhis readers share a tradition, it makes sense to interpret his words\\nin the context of that shared tradition.  That\\'s what makes me think\\nthat these arguments over words turn out to be silly.  We know that\\nPaul came out of a background that was rather Puritanical on sex.\\nEverything else he says on sex is consistent with that background.\\nThe tone of his remarks on homosexuality in Rom 1 is consistent with\\nthat background.  Even if the words in the sin lists aren\\'t the most\\ngeneral terms for homosexual activity (and it seems to me that there\\'s\\nsome evidence that they are not), they are just one more piece of\\nevidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no\\nevidence at all -- that Paul shares the common Jewish rejection of\\nhomosexuality.\\n\\nBut when you identify (a) with the Catholic position, that\\'s rather a\\nhorse of a different color.  The Catholic position involves a\\ncontinuing church tradition.  Arguments specific to that tradition\\nmight be (1) we can get guidance on how to interpret Paul\\'s original\\nmeaning from tradition, e.g. the way the Church Fathers interpreted\\nhim, and (2) we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in\\nour time because of the universal judgement of the church between his\\ntime and ours.  I think this is a somewhat different use of tradition.\\nA radical Protestant might be willing to use known 1st Cent.\\ntradition to illuminate Paul\\'s original meaning, but not use the\\nCatholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to\\nhomosexuality should be.',\n",

The Jets dominated the second,\\nchecking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged\\nby a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early. \\n\\tThe hard work paid off late in the second, when Tie Domi caught\\nVancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make\\nthe score 2-1. \\n\\tDomi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush\\nto the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do \\nanything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were\\nallowed to set up and make plays.\\n\\tBoth goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably.\\nMcLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne\\nwhile Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous\\non the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck\\nzone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four\\nchecking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead.\\n\\tA series of minor penalties at the end of the second period\\nresulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The\\nJet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's\\nlegs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2.\\n\\tThe Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off.\\nThis was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected\\nor were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight\\nWinnipeg defence that were never supported.\\n\\tHowever, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive\\nlapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff\\nin the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with\\nno Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the\\ngame up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a \\nbackhand even though he was off balance. \\n\\tBy then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it\\nto the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing\\nfor their attack. Canucks 3, Winnipeg 2.\\n\\tNext game is Friday at Winnipeg with the Jets in the hole by two games.\\n- 30 -\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

The nature of Heaven is such that it\\'s impossible for a\\nhuman being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying\\ngrace.  To use my example, it would be like taking that rock and\\nattempting to hold a conversation with it: rocks cannot talk.

The founder of this\\nmovement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to \\nbe the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures\\nof almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the \\nfulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ\\n(metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.\\n\\n        The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and\\nextreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of \\ndivine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial-\\nly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to \\nopenly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims\\nhas been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United\\nNations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International\\nand top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns \\nagainst this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the\\nmembers of this movement, but so far to no avail.\\n\\n        Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-\\ninues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the\\nworld in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-\\ntural backgrounds.\\n\\n        The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards\\ndeveloping a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims\\nhave always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-\\ngious intolerance and fundamentalism.\\n\\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\\ntablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics\\nin many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by\\nvolunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement\\'s\\ninternal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa-\\ntion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of\\nprofessionals as well as world class individuals.\\n\\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\\nreform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\\none universal brotherhood.\\n\\n\\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \\n==================\\n\\n        The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi-\\ncially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news-\\ngroup gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more \"YES/Create\" votes than\\n\"NO/don\\'t create\" votes; the newsgroup shall be created. \\n\\n\\nABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER: \\n====================\\n\\n        Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents of\\nthis newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the\\nproposed newsgroup.

       " '\\nThis is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding\\nof what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth\\'s\\natmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive\\nanswer is \"photosynthesis\", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis\\nby itself can\\'t make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced\\nis consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed\\nis photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of\\nthe resulting reduced material.\\n\\nOn earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic\\nmatter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires\\ncontinental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow\\nthat most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).\\n\\nThis suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without\\ncontinents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating\\nan oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a\\nhard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.\\n\\nThere is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth\\'s atmosphere\\nhas been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least\\n2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to\\nweathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback\\nmechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak\\nanthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen\\nlevel had dropped too low, we wouldn\\'t be here to be wondering about\\nit.',\n",

       " '(This is a continuation of an earlier post)\\n\\n\\n(I am sorry you found this offensive.  It was not my intent to offend.  I was \\nleading up to another point, which I discuss in more detail below.)\\n\\n\\nI can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for \\nhomosexuality.  Certainly if I spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of \\nbestiality, nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe.  Let me ask \\nthis gently:  why are you so judgemental of other people\\'s sexual preferences?  \\nWhat happened to \"No doubt I am free to do anything\"?  I think you have a \\nserious double standard here.  When you describe a comparison between \\nhomosexuality and bestiality as \"slimey\" and \"sleazy\", you are making an \\nimplicit judgement that bestiality is perverted, sinful, disgusting, \\nunnatural--in short, all the things that society once thought about \\nhomosexuality.  Not all people share your view.  You claim not to know any \\nsincere zoophiles, but this does not mean that they do not exist.  They even \\nhave their own newsgroup:  alt.sex.bestiality.  Are you going to accuse them \\nall of being mere \"jokers\"?\\n\\nI notice you deleted the main point of my comment:  the fact that the only \\nBiblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the Levitical \\nprohibitions against homosexuality.  While there are some New Testament \\npassages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality, there are none \\nthat condemn bestiality.  One of your main points seems to be that Christian \\nhomosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any \"clear\" New Testament \\nstatements against it; if this is a valid argument, then should not Christian \\nzoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the New Testament \\nmakes no reference, clear or unclear, to the subject at all?\\n\\nI am quite serious here.  If I am going to accept homosexuality as Biblically \\nacceptable on the basis of your arguments, then I am going to be fair and apply \\nthe same standards to everyone else\\'s declared sexual preferences as well.  If \\nthe arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual \\npreferences as well, I\\'m going to apply them and see what comes up.  I\\'m not \\ntrying to \"torpedo a serious issue\" by using what you label \"a ridiculous \\njoke\".  I posted a question about how we should interpret Biblical guidelines \\nfor Christian sexuality, and I don\\'t think such a question is \"irrelevant\" in a \\ngroup called \"soc.religion.christian\".  The Bible discusses homosexuality and \\nbestiality together in the same context, and therefore I feel I have a good \\nprecedent for doing the same.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know whether it makes any difference, but for the record, this is not a \\nside issue for me.  I believe loving one another includes not encouraging \\npeople to defile themselves, therefore it is of high importance to determine \\nwhether God regards certain sexual acts as defiling.  I can read in the New \\nTestament that \"God has joined together\" heterosexual couples, and that the \\nmarriage bed is undefiled.  I can read in the Old Testament that homosexual \\nintercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under \\nthe Law.  If gay Christians can validly put aside the Old Testament standards \\nof defilement, then I want to know so that I can fairly apply it to all the \\nsexual practices that defiled a person in the old days.  I don\\'t think it\\'s \\nright to take just bits and pieces of the Law and try and apply them to \\nChristians today, e.g. bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesn\\'t.  \\nThat was pretty much what you said earlier, right?  You used different \\nexamples, but I think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong \\nto apply only certain parts of the Law to Christians. \\n\\n\\nIt was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction.  I personally don\\'t \\nget all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual \\norientation; I\\'m afraid I naively assumed that others would have a similar \\nattitude.  Please note that I have never intended to equate homosexuality with \\nchild abuse.  I have merely noted that, for all the lack of \"clear\" NT \\ncondemnation of homosexuality, there is an even greater lack of NT condemnation \\n(or even mention) of bestiality, a practice which a number of people (e.g. on \\nalt.sex.bestiality) consider to be their true sexual orientation.\\n\\n\\nThis is an excellent question, and I pray that you will not treat it as a mere \\nrhetorical question, but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the \\nanswer.  I recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you \\nyourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia.  Why do you find \\nbestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in \\nconnection with other alternative sexual orientations?  Why do you not apply \\nall the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply \\nthem to homosexuals?\\n\\nIs it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at \\nthe thought?  A lot of people have the same experience at the thought of \\nhomosexual intercourse.  Is it because you regard the practice as socially \\nunacceptable?  A lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable.  \\nDo you feel that it violates the traditional Judeo-Christian standard of sexual \\nmorality?  Many people feel that homosexuality does.  Do you feel the Bible \\ncondemns it?  Many people think the Bible says more to condemn homosexuality \\nthan it does to condemn bestiality.  Why then do you think comparing bestiality \\nwith homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality?  If you can honestly answer \\nthis question, you will have come a long way towards understanding why many \\npeople feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality.\\n\\nAlso please note that I am not in any sense condemning *people*.  I am merely \\npointing out that when I read the Bible I see certain sexual *practices* that \\nthe Bible appears to condemn, e.g. sex outside of marriage.  When I say I think \\nadultery and pre-marital sex are sinful, do you take that as me failing to love \\nmy neighbor?  When you treat bestiality as something disgusting and \\nunmentionable, are you disobeying \"repeated orders not to judge or condemn \\nothers\"?  When you say other Christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you \\nand judging you, are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same \\noffense?  Or are you and I both simply taking note about *practices* the Bible \\nbrands as sinful, and leaving the judgement of the *people* up to God?\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not sure what you mean by the above two paragraphs.  If you mean that Jesus \\nis the Truth, and that He accepts sinners, and does not reject them, then I \\nagree.  If we were not sinners, then we would not *need* a Savior.  Our \\nsalvation in Christ, however, does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us, \\nand we can now do whatever we want.  Nor does Christ\\'s grace mean that those \\nwho refer to sin as \"sin\" are being judgemental or intolerant.  I am speaking \\nin general terms here, not specifically about homosexuality.  If the Bible \\ncalls something \"sin\", then it is not unreasonable for Christians to call it \\nsin too.\\n\\nAs applied to Christian homosexuality, I think the only definitive authority on \\nChristian sexuality is the Bible.  If you make a list of everything the Bible \\nsays on the subject of homosexual intercourse, I think you will find that every \\nverse on the list is negative and condemning at worst, and \"unclear\" at best.  \\nThe most pro-gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some \\ndispute about the New Testament verses which many people interpret as \\ncondemning homosexual intercourse.  That is, from a gay perspective, the most \\npositive thing you can say about the Bible\\'s treatment of homosexuality is that \\nsome verses fail to clearly condemn it.  That\\'s it.  Jesus declared all foods \\nclean, the council at Jerusalem declared that Gentiles were not required to \\nkeep the ritual Law, but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from \\nbeing an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted Christian \\npractice.  You have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination \\nthat defiles both Jews under the Law and Gentiles not under the Law, and you \\nhave some verses which are at best \"not clear\" but which some people believe \\n*are* clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior, and that\\'s the sum \\ntotal of what the Bible says about same-sex intercourse.\\n\\nI can appreciate (from personal experience) your desire to have everything \\nsimple, cut-and-dried, black-and-white, what-I-want- is-ok, and \\nthose-who-oppose-me-are-wicked.  However, I do not think the Bible makes your \\ncase as definitively as you would like it to.  In fact, I don\\'t believe it says \\nanything positive about your case at all.  Yes, I know the verses about loving \\none another, and not judging one another, but that\\'s not really the issue, is \\nit?  You know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for \\nChristians to do, since you say it is wrong for Christians to condemn you.  \\nTherefore, the issue is whether the Bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin.  \\nEven if you do challenge the clarity of the New Testament verses, you are still \\nleft with the fact that the only thing the Bible does say clearly about \\nhomosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who \\nare under the law and those who are not.\\n\\n- Mark\\n',\n",

       " 'It troubles me that there have been so many posts recently trying to support\\nthe doctrine of Original Sin.  This is primarily a Catholic doctrine, with no\\nother purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism.  Even among, its\\nsupporters, however, people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infants\\nwill go to hell.\\n\\nIt\\'s very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of\\nscripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine.  However, if we have the\\nheart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblically\\nbased, then we can come to an understanding of the truth.  Let\\'s now take a\\nmore complete look at scripture.\\n\\nColossians 2:11-12 \"In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of\\nthe sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by Christ, having been\\nburied with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the\\npower of God, who raised him from the dead.\"\\n\\nIn baptism, we are raised to a new life in Christ (Romans 6:4) through a\\npersonal faith in the power of God.  Our parent\\'s faith cannot do this.  Do\\ninfants have faith?  Let\\'s look at what the Bible has to say about it.\\n\\nRomans 10:16-17 \"But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  For\\nIsaiah says, \\'Lord, who has believed our message?\\'  Consequently, faith\\ncomes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word\\nof Christ.\"\\n\\nSo then we receive God\\'s gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the\\ngospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God\\'s word preached.  Kids\\nare not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to\\nrespond to God\\'s word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot\\nbe raised in baptism to a new life.\\n\\nEzekiel 18:20 \"The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the\\nguilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The\\nrighteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the\\nwickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.\"\\n\\nIf you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn\\'t hold us guilty\\nfor anyone else\\'s sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam.\\n\\nEzekiel 18:31-32 \"Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted,\\nand get a new heart and a new spirit.  Why will you die, O house of Israel?\\nFor I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord.\\nRepent and live!\"\\n\\nThe way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit.  Kids\\ncannot do this.  Acts 2:38-39 says that when we repent and are baptized, we\\nwill then receive a new spirit, the Holy Spirit.  Then we shall live.\\n\\nNow then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is\\nnot Biblical, let\\'s look at some of the scriptures used to support it.\\n\\nRomans 5:12 \"Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and\\ndeath through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all\\nsinned--\"\\n\\nSin and death entered the world when the first man sinned.  Death came to\\neach man because each man sinned.  Note that it\\'s good to read through all\\nof Romans 5:12-21.  Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than\\nothers, but if we read them in context we will see that they are all\\nsaying basically the same thing.  Let\\'s look at one such.\\n\\nRomans 5:19 \"For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many\\nwere made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many\\nwill be made righteous.\"\\n\\nThrough the disobedience of each individual, each was made a sinner.  In\\nthe same way, through the obedience of Jesus, each will be made righteous.\\nWe must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each\\nman only because each man sinned, not because of guilt from Adam.\\nOtherwise the Bible would contradict itself.  I encourage you to read\\nthrough this whole passage on your own, looking at it from this point of\\nview to see if it doesn\\'t all fit together.\\n\\nPsalm 51:5 \"Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother\\nconceived me.\"\\n\\nThis whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves\\nbefore God in repentance for sinning.  David himself was a man after God\\'s\\nown heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba and\\nmurdering her husband.  All that David is saying here is that he can\\'t\\nremember a time when he wasn\\'t sinful.  He is humbling himself before God\\nby confessing his sinfulness.  His saying that he was sinful at birth is\\na hyperbole.  The Bible, being inspired by God, isn\\'t limited to a literal\\ninterpetation, but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus (John 16:25).\\nFor another example of hyperbole, see Luke 14:26.\\n\\nNow then, even though people see that baptism requires faith and that\\noriginal sin is not Biblical, they will still argue that infant baptism is\\nnecessary because children sin by being selfish - not sharing toys with\\nother children, by being mean - hitting others and fighting, etc.\\n\\nCertainly we have observed children doing wrong things, but my gut feeling\\nis always that they don\\'t know any better.  Let\\'s look to see if the Bible\\nagrees with my gut feelings.\\n\\nIsaiah 7:14-15 \"Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign:  The\\nvirgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him\\nImmanuel.  He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the\\nwrong and choose the right.\"\\n\\nNow just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy\\nabout Jesus.  If they don\\'t, then point them to Matthew 1:23 and find a new\\nleader.  Jesus certainly couldn\\'t have had less knowledge than normal human\\nbabies.  Yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent\\nbefore he would know the difference between right and wrong.  We see that\\nhe did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.  The implication is\\nthat Jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over\\nwrong.  Since we know that Jesus was perfect -- without sin, we have rather\\nconclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they don\\'t know to choose\\nthe right instead of the wrong.\\n\\nJesus himself was baptized, albeit with John\\'s baptism, not as an infant,\\nbut as a thirty-year-old man (Luke 3:21-23) and started his ministry as\\nsoon as he was baptized (Luke 3:23).

       " '\\nOnce the Rushdie situation exploded into the media, the Muslim voice on\\nthe matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes\\nshowing\\nthe dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations. For every twenty or so\\nnewspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, there\\nwould\\nappear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on how\\ndramatic and incoherent he was, not on his knowledge of Islam or the\\nsituation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continued\\nthroughout the escalation of the crisis, with Rushdie in the central\\nspotlight as the man of the moment, the valiant defender of everyman\\'s\\nright to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside, it\\'s\\ninteresting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up,\\nsome books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued\\nto be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these\\n\\ngroups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of \\nhate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard \\nwas annoying.)\\n\\nRushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at\\n\"organized\"\\nIslam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam\\nwhich Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a \"secular\" Islam - an Islam\\nseparated from it\\'s Qur\\'an, it\\'s Prophet, God, its legislation, and most\\nimportantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie\\nmade\\nhis views known - the Muslim\\'s made their anger at his book known. The\\nscale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by this\\ntime,\\nalready a political situation - affecting governments as well as\\nindividuals.\\nThe situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications.\\nAt the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire -\\nengaged\\nin a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.\\n\\nNow you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as\\n\\nthis has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of any\\nkind, has no\\nobligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till\\nmatters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in \"boldly\"\\ndefying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary\\nwork, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as\\na kind of secular \"heroic Knight\",mounted on the his media steed,\\n doing battle with the \"dragon\" of Islamic \"fundamentalism\".\\n\\nWell Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who \\ngrew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslim\\'s hold dear, \\nwho wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions\\nto slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities -\\nwho, when\\nfaced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued with\\nhis mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people were\\ninjured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation,\\ncontinued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist.\\nKhomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischief\\nmaking that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths\\nof Muslims around the world and Rushdie\\'s continued media mischief\\neven after this, was the triggering factor that seemed to\\ndecide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the\\ncentre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the\\ncontinuing mischief - all media support, government support was\\njust that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, who\\nwere nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy\\nto see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that\\ndeal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief\\nmaking, was applied to Rushdie.\\n\\n\\nI have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. \"Image\" is\\nthe chief concern of Muslim \\'apologists\\' for Islam and for Rushdie.\\nIf Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture\\nwithin a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and laws\\nhad precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam\\nwould then be thought to have a good \"image\" (Principally because it would\\nby and large reflect the secular image). A \"good image\" usually means \" be\\nmore\\nlike me\".\\n\\nYour attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude\\nthat\\nresulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.\\n',\n",

       " 'It\\'s been a while since I\\'ve reviewed a car but today I paid a visit\\nto an old friend whose love for Audis has been so overwhelming that he\\nmakes a not too sucessful living selling them.\\n\\nWithout further delay, I will get to the 1993 Audi S4:\\n\\n\\n1) Servotronic steering:\\n\\n[For those who are not familiar with what Servotronic is, it is the\\nname for the speed variable power steering manufactured by ZF and\\nused in Audis and BMWs.]\\n\\nI have been outspoken in my damming of Servotronic over the past\\ncouple of months, and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of\\nthe Audi 90 CS quattro and the Audi 100CS fwd.  I am quite happy to\\nreport now that on the S4, the Servotronic is *inoffensive*.  I\\nsuppose that due to the fat gumball tires, the Servotronic has been\\nloaded up more and this, so far has been the best implementation that\\nI have tried.  It is far from perfect, mind you, and I\\'d be much\\nhappier if it was an option that I could refuse, but on the S4, I no\\nlonger consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car is\\nruined.\\n\\nThe steering is still a tad too light, but it is accurate and I\\nsuppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that\\nsome makes it through to the driver\\'s hands.  So there is feel and\\nthere is accuracy in the S4\\'s steering.  But there is also room for\\nimprovement.  I consider the S4\\'s steering to be better than the\\nJapanese competition, primarily because the Japanese do not believe in\\n\"feel\" and engineer it out completely.\\n\\n\\n2) Engine\\n\\nWheee! What a pressure cooker.  With just 110 miles on the clock I did\\nnot expect the S4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be\\nputting out 10000 miles later, but still, the car packs a terrific\\npunch.  For a turbocharged machine, it is very unusual in that it\\nencourages lazy driving.  i.e. low revs, high gear.  It is so\\nsupremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there\\'s only 2.2\\nliters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a\\nfashion.  With maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm\\nredline, the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. which\\ntranslates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph.  A\\nchracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity V8s.\\nThe technical achievement is breadthtaking.\\n\\nThrottle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine. In\\nfact, it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame. Downshifts\\nare almost unnecessary.  It is more fun to use the \"overboost\" feature\\nthan to rev the engine.  For those not familiar, the S4 engine features\\nup to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing.  Sort of like\\nlighting up the after burners in a jet fighter, one could, with the\\nright foot only, in third gear, blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a\\nfew moments.. simply by flooring the gas.  As far as the numbers go,\\nmaximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lb\\nft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter.  It takes a few moments for it to\\ndevelop overboost but it is well worth waiting for.  Since this is quite\\na heavy car, one\\'s body parts are not flung around like say, the Corrado\\nVR6.  The acceleration is smooth and strong, somewhat similar to riding\\nin a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff.  Also, one\\nis treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the\\nturbo.. the only entertaining sound to come out of a very\\nrefined but bland sounding 5 banger..\\n\\nYes, Audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds as\\nserene as it does at 2000.  The smoothness is outstanding, but not quite\\nup to the standards of a very good 6, e.g. a 12 valve BMW.  I\\'d say that\\nin terms of refinement, i.e. willingness to rev, smoothness, lack of\\nharshness under full acceleration it is better than many V6s.  However,\\nlost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder bark\\nthat made the older engines so characterful, if not terribly refined.\\nThe 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under\\nfull boost.  Subjectively, I\\'d rate the VW VR6 engine as being far more\\nmusical than the turbo 5.. Also, Audi\\'s own V8 is also far more musical,\\nwith a rorty race car growl when pressed,  though none of these can\\nmatch its grunt.\\n\\nThe only hint of the engine\\'s true capacity occurs when one is taking\\noff from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop.  With the extra\\ninertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system, one has to be somewhat\\ndelicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall. \\nAlternately one could use more revs.. In both cases a very small price\\nto pay for such a fantastic engine.  I think that Audi of America should\\noffer an automatic option for this car, just as they offer (though in\\nextremely small numbers) a 5 speed for the much peakier V8.  The\\ncharacteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic.  Ironically,\\nin europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the\\nslush.  Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again...\\n\\n\\n3) Chassis\\n\\nI\\'ve noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively\\nmodest tire widths.  The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16..\\nwhich is not uncommon at all.  However, the very attractive 5 spoke\\nwheels are no less than 8 inches wide, so there is no sidewall bulge\\nwhatsoever.  Combined with the flared wheel arches, the S4 has a mouth\\nwatering macho, yet subdued look. \\n\\nOn rough concrete, it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body\\nstyle has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as\\nroad noise suppression.. I suppose the two are inter-related, but I\\ndigress.  To use a cliche, the S4\\'s body feels like it has been carved\\nout of stone.  Flex is totally undetectable, even when going over rough\\nroads.  With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers\\ndo not cause excessive harshness and while the S4\\'s ride quality will\\nnever worry a Lexus, it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or\\npony cars.\\n\\nThe servotronic steering has already been mentioned.  I consider it to\\nbe inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering.  I  was\\nable to test the car\\'s cornering powers without too much trepidation. I\\nthink a new concept is at work in this car.  With its fat gumball tires,\\ntalking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless.  On a\\nbanked highway on ramp, I went in slow and started applying power as I\\nwent around.  I could feel the g forces build to the point where the\\nskin on my face was being tugged sideways.  Yet the car was totally and\\ncompletely obedient to throttle and steering inputs.. It felt that the\\nlimits were not even close to being approached.  The g forces were\\nthrilling, but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely\\nuninvolving.  You tell the car what you want and it does it.  End of\\nstory.  I think that I am starting to relate more and more to those\\nreviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX\\'s clinical\\nefficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car.\\n\\nThe brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty\\nwell too, though I\\'ve read that they are prone to fade.  I am not too\\nsurprised, since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi\\n100 fwd. Harder pads would help, but that in turn would lead to a more\\nwooden response when cold.  I am starting to see a trend among the\\nluxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by\\nadditional braking capacity.  The LS400\\'s fade performance is nothing to\\nbrag about; neither is the Q45\\'s or the Legend\\'s.  Brake fade these days\\nseem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody\\'s attention is focused on\\nanti-lock capability.\\n\\n\\n4) Comfort\\n\\nFor a car with such sporty abilities, its comfort levels are also\\nexcellent.  The cabin is beautifully appointed, with carbon-fiber panel\\ninserts in place of the wood trim of the \\'92 S4.  All the expected\\ngizmos are there.. heated seats, power seats, seat memory, power this\\nand that.  The glaring ommision was the trip computer, which was removed\\nbecause Audi hasn\\'t gotten it to work reliably yet.. That means that the\\ncar has no boost gauge.  A real disappointment taking into account how\\nmuch the turbo dominates its performance.  \\n\\nUnusual for the germans, the S4 comes with a Honda style moonroof, as\\nwell as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch.\\n\\nNoise levels, including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn\\'t\\nconsider the Lexus\\' advantage in this area to be significant enough\\nto sway a potential buyer.\\n\\n\\n5) Conclusion\\n\\nEven though few will be able to afford an Audi S4 at its sticker price\\nof $48K, the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to\\noffer over the competition.  The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem, even if\\nit doesn\\'t produce Ferrari sounds.  No other luxury/sports sedan maker\\noffers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive, which to some is\\nworth the extra money all by itself.  The safety features are also \\ntop notch.. 1994 side impact standard compliant, the very elegant \\nautomatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags.  The 100 series\\nAudis have been outstanding in government crash tests.  It gets my\\nthumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being\\nall out exciting and intoxicating.\\n',\n",

And HST is now in a lower \\norbit.  \\n\\nSeems like the limiting factors would be crew fatigue and mission complexity.\\n\",\n",

The second part is \\n  posted to comp.sys.mac.system and features many questions about\\n  system  software.  The third part is posted every two weeks in\\n  comp.sys.mac.misc.  Tables of contents for those two pieces are\\n  included above. Please familiarize  yourself with all three\\n  sections of this document  before posting. \\n  \\n         All pieces  are available for anonymous ftp from\\n  rtfm.mit.edu (18.172.1.27) in the directory \\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh.  Except for this introductory\\n  FAQ which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as\\n  general-faq.Z, the name of each file has the format of the last\\n  part of the group name followed by \"-faq.Z\", e.g the FAQ for\\n  comp.sys.mac.system is stored as system-faq.Z and the FAQ for\\n  comp.sys.mac.misc is stored as misc-faq.Z.  RTFM stores files as \\n  compressed (.Z) BINARY files.  If you leave off the .Z at the end\\n  of  the file name when \"getting\" the file, rtfm will automatically \\n  decompress the file before sending it to you.  You can also have \\n  these files mailed to you by sending an E-mail message to \\n  mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the line:  send\\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh/\"name\"  in the body text where\\n  \"name\" is the name of the file you want as  specified above (e.g.\\n  general-faq).  You can also send this server a message with the\\n  subject \"help\" for more detailed instructions.   \\n\\n    \\n\\n ==================== \\n I HAVE A QUESTION...  (1.0)\\n ====================\\n  \\n       Congratulations!  You\\'ve come to the right place.  Usenet is \\n  a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions\\n  (How do I lock a floppy disk?) to queries that would make Steve\\n  Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror.  (I used\\n  ResEdit to remove resources Init #11, WDEF 34, and nVIR 17 from my\\n  system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string #A67B45 as a\\n  patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box\\n  would be a nice shade of mauve.  Everything worked fine until I\\n  installed SuperCDevBlaster, and now when I use the Aldus driver to\\n  print from PageMaker 5.0d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs. \\n  P.S.  I\\'m running System 6.0.2 on a PowerBook 170.) \\n  \\n       Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume, we\\n  ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the\\n  table of contents for the other pieces of it, check any other\\n  relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2, especially\\n  the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups, and RTFM (Read\\n  the Friendly Manual) before posting your question.  We realize that\\n  you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen\\n  of your newly-installed twenty megs of RAM, but this question has\\n  already made its way around the world three hundred times before,\\n  and it\\'s developing tired feet.  Finally, before posting to any\\n  newsgroup (Macintosh or otherwise), please familiarize yourself\\n  with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup\\n  news.announce.newusers.\\n\\n\\n HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT?  WHERE CAN I GET IT?  (1.1) \\n     \\n         comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces,\\n  a general introduction which you\\'re reading now, and specific lists\\n  for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc.  FAQ\\n  lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted, comp.sys.mac.apps and\\n  comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development.  When ready each part\\n  will be available in its respective newsgroup.  All pieces are\\n  available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the\\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory. Except for this\\n  document itself which is named general-faq.Z the pieces are named\\n  as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by\\n  \"-faq\", e.g. system-faq.Z, misc-faq.Z.  The .Z means the  file is\\n  stored compressed so you\\'ll need to ftp it in binary mode and use\\n  either MacCompress, StuffIt Deluxe, or the UNIX uncompress command \\n  to decompress it.  However if you leave off the \".Z\" extension when\\n   you \"get\" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file\\n  before sending it to you. \\n  \\n         This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned\\n  newsgroups.  The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ\\n  lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to\\n  get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere\\n  else in the FAQ even if you don\\'t have the other parts at hand. \\n  It\\'s not always obvious, especially to newcomers, where a\\n  particular question or comment should be posted.  Please\\n  familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh\\n  newsgroups before posting in any of them.  Which questions appear\\n  in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong\\n  where. \\n  \\n         To jump to a particular question search for\\n  section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses.  For\\n  example to find \"Where can I FTP Macintosh software?\" search for\\n  the string  \"(2.1)\".  To jump to a section instead of a question\\n  use a zero for  the question number.\\n\\n\\n WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?  (1.2)\\n\\n      comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of \\n  frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup\\n  comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system.  Four other files are\\n  worthy of particular note: Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list\\n  covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup\\n  comp.sys.mac.programmer.  It\\'s posted to that group weekly and \\n  available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in \\n  /pub/mac.  Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list \\n  for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from\\n  rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq (where the file you\\'re reading now\\n  is also irregularly archived).  This list answers many frequently\\n  asked questions about networking, UNIX and the Mac,\\n  telecommunications, and foreign file formats.  Norm Walsh has\\n  compiled an excellent FAQ for comp.fonts that answers a lot of\\n  questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform\\n  conversion and printing.  It\\'s available in comp.fonts or by ftp\\n  from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/FAQ*.  Finally Jim\\n  Jagielski maintains a FAQ for comp.unix.aux covering Apple\\'s UNIX\\n  environment, A/UX.  It\\'s posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux\\n  and news.answers. It\\'s available for anonymous ftp at\\n  jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov.\\n\\n\\n WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO?  (1.3)\\n  \\n      There are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones. \\n  You wouldn\\'t ask your English teacher how to do the definite\\n  integral  of ln x between zero and one, would you?  So don\\'t ask\\n  the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft\\n  Word is in the background.  Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an\\n  excuse. If you want people to help you, you need to learn their\\n  ways of  communicating.  \\n  \\n      Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your\\n  mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too\\n  :-) ).  Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering\\n  silence.  For instance the most common and glaring mispost, one\\n  that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of\\n  Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic, asking a\\n  question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm,\\n  normally produces no useful responses.  Posting the same question\\n  to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered\\n  by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few\\n  network software designers.\\n  \\n         Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup.  Do not cross-post. \\n  If a question isn\\'t important enough for you to take the extra\\n  minute to figure out where it properly belongs, it\\'s not important\\n  enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading. \\n  For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a\\n  catch-all newsgroup.\\n  \\n         The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in\\n  this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs\\n  where.  Specifically questions about productivity applications\\n  (software you bought your Macintosh to run, not software you bought\\n  to make your Macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps\\n  unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup. \\n  Communications programs, games, HyperCard, compilers and databases\\n  all have more topical comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups.  Post questions\\n  about non-communications hardware including questions about what\\n  software is necessary to make particular hardware work to\\n  comp.sys.mac.hardware.  Questions about MacOS system software\\n  belong in comp.sys.mac.system.  Questions about utilities and\\n  extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc.  Questions about\\n  A/UX go to comp.unix.aux.  Detailed questions about Appletalk\\n  belong in comp.protocols.appletalk.\\n  \\n         Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard. \\n  Non-HyperCard programming questions and questions about development\\n  environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer.  ResEdit\\n  questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc,\\n  comp.sys.mac.system, or comp.sys.mac.programmer; but generally the\\n  netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer\\n  are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking. \\n  \\n         A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY\\n  technical question about an application that actually begins to\\n  delve into the how\\'s of a program as well as the what\\'s (Recent\\n  example: How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly\\n  compare to other word processors written in high level languages?)\\n  might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup.\\n    \\n         For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to\\n  comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac ONLY.  We\\n  understand that you\\'re desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to\\n  get the $$ for a PowerBook 180; but trust me, anyone who wants to\\n  buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted.  Political and\\n  religious questions (The Mac is better than Windows! Is not! Is\\n  too! Is not! Is too! Hey! How \\'bout the Amiga! What about it? Is\\n  Not! Is too!) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy.  Anything not\\n  specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc.\\n  \\n         Finally don\\'t be so provincial as to consider only the\\n  comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions. \\n  Many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more\\n  thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems.  Questions about Mac MIDI\\n  are often better handled in comp.music even though it\\'s not a\\n  Macintosh specific newsgroup.  Shop around.  Usenet\\'s a big place\\n  and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in\\n  comp.sys.mac.\\n\\n\\n 4. SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF\\n THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM.  SHOULDN\\'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND\\n WIT ON  DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE?\\n\\n      No.  Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as\\n  frequent questions.  Unless you really have something new to add to\\n  the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in\\n  System 7.1 could eat memory) private E-mail is a much better medium\\n  for answering common questions like this one.\\n   \\n         You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E-mail\\n  response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it\\n  before posting future questions.  I do read all the newsgroups\\n  covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that\\n  lets me send PWFAQ\\'s (people with frequently asked questions) the\\n  section of this document that answers their question with just the\\n  click of a button so please don\\'t feel obligated to respond to\\n  someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they\\n  can\\'t be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it.\\n\\n    \\n\\n === \\n FTP  (2.0) \\n ===\\n\\n WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE?  (2.1)\\n\\n      The three major North American Internet archives of shareware,\\n  freeware, and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6),\\n  mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41), and wuarchive.wustl.edu\\n  (128.252.135.4) which mirrors the other two sites and several\\n  others. Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove\\n  them for space concerns, and still has files that were deleted from\\n  the formerly important site, rascal.ics.utexas.edu.  Rascal was\\n  notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the\\n  less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives.  Unless\\n  otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document\\n  should be available at the above sites.\\n  \\n       To keep traffic on the Internet manageable, Scandinavians \\n  should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), ftp.lth.se\\n  (130.235.20.3), or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead.  Those in \\n  the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1). \\n  Continental Europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40),  \\n  ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72), and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1). \\n  Australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au\\n  (139.130.4.6) which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive.  Japanese\\n  users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp\\n  (130.69.254.254). \\n\\n         A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3). \\n  This is Apple\\'s semi-official repository for system software,\\n  developer tools, source code, technical notes, and other things\\n  that come more or less straight from Apple\\'s mouth.  Some material\\n  at this site may not be distributed outside the U.S. or by other\\n  sites that don\\'t have an official license to distribute Apple\\n  system software.  Please read the various README documents\\n  available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you\\'re\\n  connecting from outside the U.S. or if you wish to redistribute\\n  material you find here.\\n\\n\\n CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL?  (2.2)\\n\\n      The info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by E-mail from\\n  LISTSERV@RICEVM1.bitnet (alternately listserv@ricevm1.rice.edu). \\n  The listserver responds to the commands $MACARCH HELP, $MACARCH\\n  INDEX, and $MACARCH GET filename.  Mac archive files are available\\n  from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu.  Send it a message containing the\\n  words \"help\" and \"index\" (no quotes) on the first two lines of your\\n  message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files\\n  you may request.  You can retrieve files from other sites by using\\n  the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  For details send it a\\n  message with just the text \"help\" (no quotes).\\n\\n\\n WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X?  (2.3)\\n\\n      If you can\\'t find what you\\'re looking for at one of the above\\n  sites, try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it\\n  an E-mail message addressed to archie with the subject \"help.\" \\n  Archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15,\\n  America), archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3, the original archie server\\n  in Canada), archie.au (139.130.4.6, Australia), archie.funet.fi\\n  (128.214.6.100, Scandinavia), and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7,\\n  the U.K. and the continent).  These sites index the tens of\\n  thousands of files available for anonymous ftp.  Login as \"archie\"\\n  (no password is needed) and type \"prog filename\" to find what\\n  you\\'re looking for or type \"help\" for more detailed instructions. \\n  For instance you would type \"prog Disinfectant\" to search for a\\n  convenient ftp site for Disinfectant.  If the initial search fails\\n  to turn up the file you want, try variations on and substrings of\\n  the name.  For instance if you didn\\'t find Disinfectant with \"prog\\n  Disinfectant\", you might try \"prog disi\" instead.  Substring\\n  searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross.  To avoid many\\n  erroneous matches add a \".*\\\\.hqx\" to the end of the substring, e.g.\\n  \"prog disi.*\\\\.hqx\"  Most Mac software available on the net ends in\\n  .hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does. \\n\\n         Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE\\n  asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware.  If you\\n  follow the above advice, you should almost never have to ask the\\n  net where to find a particular piece of software.\\n\\n\\n CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X?  (2.4)\\n\\n      No.  Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from\\n  comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site.  Please\\n  refer to the first questions in this section to find out about\\n  anonymous FTP, archie, and automatic E-mail servers.\\n\\n\\n WHAT IS .BIN? .HQX? .CPT? .ETC?  (2.5)\\n\\n      Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to\\n  more easily pass through foreign computer systems.  First they\\'re\\n  compressed to make them faster to download, and then they\\'re\\n  translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary (.bin) format\\n  that other computers can digest.  (The Macintosh uses a special\\n  two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.)  BinHex\\n  files are 7-bit ASCII text files, while MacBinary files are pure\\n  8-bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary\\n  protocol.\\n  \\n         How a file has been translated and compressed for\\n  transmission is indicated by its suffix.  Normally a file will have\\n  a name something like filename.xxx.yyy.  .xxx indicates how it was\\n  compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated.  To use a file\\n  you\\'ve FTP\\'d and downloaded to your Mac you\\'ll need to reverse the\\n  process.  Most files you get from the net require a two-step\\n  decoding process.  First change the binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary\\n  (.bin) file to a double-clickable Macintosh file; then decompress\\n  it.  Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table\\n  below.  Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs\\n  will  automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh\\n  files as they are downloaded.\\n\\n***************************************************************************\\nSuffix:      .sit  .cpt  .hqx  .bin  .pit  .Z  .image  .dd  .zip .uu  .tar \\nExtractors\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nStuffIt 3.0|   X     X     X     X     X                  \\nCompact Pro|         X     X \\nPackit     |                           X\\nUUTool     |                                                      X \\nMacCompress|                                X \\nSunTar     |               X     X     X                                X \\nBinHex 5.0 |                     X \\nBinHex 4.0 |               X \\nDiskDoubler|                           X                X \\nUnZip      |                                                   X \\nDiskCopy   |                                     X \\nmacutil    |         X     X           X                X\\n***************************************************************************\\n\\n     A few notes on the decompressors:\\n\\n      StuffIt is a family of products that use several different\\n  compression schemes.  The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff\\n  all of them.  Versions of StuffIt earlier than 3.0 (StuffIt 1.5.1,\\n  StuffIt Classic, UnStuffIt, and StuffIt Deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will\\n  not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 3.0. \\n  You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt\\n  Expander. \\n    \\n         StuffIt 3.0.5 (Lite and Deluxe) consistently makes smaller\\n  archives than any other Macintosh compression utility.  To allow\\n  maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep\\n  net-bandwidth down, please compress all files you send to anonymous\\n  ftp sites with StuffIt 3.0.5.\\n   \\n         UUTool, MacCompress, and SunTar handle the popular UNIX\\n  formats of  uuencode (.uu), compress (.Z), and tar (.tar)\\n  respectively.  The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac\\n  products, so use them instead when that\\'s an  option.  Translators\\n  that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also\\n  available by anonymous ftp. \\n  \\n         Macutil is dik winter\\'s package of UNIX utilities to\\n  decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading\\n  them to a Mac. Since UNIX stores files differently than does the\\n  Mac, macutil creates MacBinary (.bin) files which should be\\n  automatically converted on download.  It can\\'t decompress\\n  everything. In particular it can\\'t decompress the new StuffIt 3.0\\n  archives. :-(  However, if you need only one or two files out of an\\n  archive--for instance if you want to read the README to find out if\\n  a program does what you need it to do before you download all of\\n  it--macutil is indispensable.  It can be found at sumex-aim in the\\n  info-mac/unix directory.\\n\\n     A few notes on the compression formats:\\n\\n      .bin:  These are MacBinary files.  Always use a binary file\\n  transfer protocol when transferring them, never ASCII or text. \\n  Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead.  Only rascal\\n  stores most of its files in .bin format.  Most communications\\n  programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating\\n  MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance\\n  they\\'ll be downloading MacBinary files.\\n  \\n      .image: This format is normally used only for system software,\\n  so that on-line users can download files that can easily be\\n  converted into exact copies of the installer floppies.  Instead of\\n  using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies, you can use Steve\\n  Christensen\\'s freeware utility  MountImage to treat the images on\\n  your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive. \\n  MountImage has a reputation for being buggy, so you should have\\n  some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case.\\n  \\n      .sea (.x, .X):  .sea files don\\'t merit a position in the above\\n  table because they\\'re self-extracting.  They may have been created\\n  with Compact Pro, StuffIt, or even DiskDoubler; but all should be\\n  capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked.  For some\\n  unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard\\n  designation for self-extracting archives created with their \\n  payware products SuperDisk! and More Disk Space.  Instead they \\n  append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives.\\n\\n\\n HOW CAN I GET BINHEX?  STUFFIT?  ETC.?  (2.6)\\n\\n      By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human\\n  being to copy them onto a floppy for you.  If you\\'re at a\\n  university there\\'s absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to\\n  give you a copy; and if you\\'re anywhere less remote than McMurdo\\n  Sound, chances are very good that someone at a computer center,\\n  dealership, or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt. \\n  Once you have StuffIt (any version) you don\\'t need BinHex.\\n    \\n         If you\\'re such a computer geek that the thought of actually\\n  asking a living, breathing human being instead of a computer \\n  terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of \\n  protoplasmic jelly, you can probably download a working copy  of\\n  StuffIt from a local bulletin board system. \\n  \\n         If you have religious objections to software gotten by any \\n  means other than anonymous ftp, then I suppose I\\'ll mention that \\n  you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by \\n  far the hardest way to get it.  Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and \\n  login.  Type the word \"binary.\"  Hit return.  Type \"cd\\n  mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression\" and hit return.  Then\\n  \"get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin\"  and hit return.  Of course\\n  it\\'s always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt\\n  Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this\\n  fails look for something similar.  If you\\'ve ftp\\'d straight onto\\n  your Mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will\\n  produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double-clicked.  If\\n  you\\'ve ftp\\'d to your mainframe or UNIX account first, you still\\n  need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac.  Just make\\n  sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe\\n  is sending in binary mode.  If you need more details on the last\\n  step, consult the FAQ list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals\\n  for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software.\\n  \\n  \\n  HOW CAN I GET BINHEX, STUFFIT, ETC. FROM A PC?  (2.7)\\n\\n       You can\\'t.  There is absolutely NO way to get an executable\\n  Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac\\n  without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp.\\n  You MUST beg, borrow, or steal the necessary software such as\\n  Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person.  I realize this may \\n  terrify those among you who haven\\'t left your parents\\' basement \\n  since you got an  Apple II+ in 1980, but eventually you\\'re going \\n  to need to link up with some human being other than your mother.  \\n  (though I suppose if you\\'re this much of  a nerd you could send \\n  your mother out to get it for you.)  While you\\'re gathering\\n  your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world \\n  of daylight, please don\\'t bother the net by asking this question\\n  again.  There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh\\n  programs from a PC or other non-Macintosh computer onto a \\n  Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs.\\n\\n\\n\\n=================================================================\\nTROUBLESHOOTING: WHAT TO DO (BEFORE POSTING) WHEN THINGS GO WRONG (3.0)\\n================================================================= \\n\\n         While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific\\n  problems, there are far more problems that aren\\'t covered here. \\n  These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking\\n  for help.  You should probably also perform the ten-step\\n  preventative maintenance routine described in section four,\\n  especially rebuilding the desktop (4.3) and resizing the system\\n  heap (4.5).  Following these steps may  or may not solve your\\n  problem, but it will at least make it easier  for others to\\n  recommend solutions to you.\\n\\n IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.  (3.1)\\n\\n      \"Microsoft Word is crashing\" doesn\\'t say much.  What were you\\n  doing when it crashed?  Can you repeat the actions that lead to the\\n  crash?  The more information you provide about the actions\\n  preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you. \\n  The more precisely you\\'ve identified the problem and the actions\\n  preceding it (Step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the\\n  following steps fix the problem.  For example, \"Sometimes\\n  QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error.\" is\\n  not nearly as helpful as \"QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes when I link two\\n  text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already\\n  contain text.\"  The former will leave you wondering whether the bug\\n  remains after a given step.  The latter lets you go right to the\\n  problem and see if it\\'s still there or not.\\n\\n\\n READ THE READ ME FILE.  (3.2)\\n\\n      Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and\\n  bugs in their READ ME files.  Often these aren\\'t documented in the\\n  manual. Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound\\n  familiar.\\n\\n\\n CHECK FOR VIRUSES.  (3.3)\\n\\n      Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk.  Virus\\n  infections are rarer than most people think, but they do occur and\\n  they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do.\\n\\n\\n REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES.  (3.4)  \\n   \\n       For half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields,\\n  improperly written software, the alignment of the planets) a file\\n  on a disk may not contain the data it\\'s supposed to contain.  This\\n  can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior.  Restoring\\n  from original masters will normally fix this.\\n\\n\\n REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE.  (3.5)  \\n\\n      Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file\\n  than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous. \\n  See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean\\n  reinstall. \\n  \\n         If the problem continues to occur after you\\'ve taken these\\n  steps, chances are you\\'ve found either a conflict between your\\n  application and some other software or a genuine bug in the\\n  program.  So it\\'s time to\\n\\n\\n ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.  (3.6)  \\n \\n         You need to find the minimal system on which the problem\\n  will assert itself.  Here are the basic steps of isolating the\\n  cause of a system or application crash:\\n  \\n     a.\\tRun only one application at a time. Occasionally applications do\\n     conflict with each other.  If the problem does not manifest itself\\n     without other applications running simultaneously, you can begin\\n     launching other applications until you find the one that causes \\n     the crash.\\n     \\n     b.\\tIf you\\'re running System 6, turn off MultiFinder.  If you\\'re\\n     running System 7, allot as much memory to the application as you \\n     can afford.  Sometimes programs just need more memory, especially \\n     when performing complicated operations.\\n     \\n     c. If you\\'re running System 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit\\n     addressing.  There\\'s still an awful lot of System 7 hostile\\n     software out there including some from companies that really \\n     have no excuse.  (Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1, boys and girls?  \\n     I knew you could.)  Some of this software only expresses its \\n     incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken.\\n     \\n     d.\\tBoot from a virgin system floppy.  If the problem disappears\\n     you likely have an init conflict.  You need to progressively remove\\n     extensions until the problem vanishes.  Use a little common sense\\n     when choosing the first extensions to remove.  If the problem occurs\\n     when you try to open a file, remove any inits that mess with the\\n     Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first.  If the\\n     problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated,\\n     either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or, if you have\\n     a lot of them, perform a binary search by removing half of the\\n     extensions at a time.  Once the problem disappears add half of the\\n     most recently removed set back.  Continue until you\\'ve narrowed the\\n     conflict down to one extension.  When you think you\\'ve found the\\n     offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make \\n     sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem.\\n\\n\\n CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  (3.7)\\n\\n      By now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why\\n  the conflict occurs.  If a tech support number is available for the\\n  software, call it.  If you\\'re lucky the company will have a work\\n  around or fix available.  If not, perhaps they\\'ll at least add the\\n  bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release.\\n\\n    \\n\\n ====================== \\n PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE  (4.0)\\n ======================\\n\\n      You wouldn\\'t drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a\\n  tune-up.  A computer is no different.  Regular tune-ups avoid a lot\\n  of problems.  Although there are Mac mechanics who\\'ll be happy to\\n  charge you $75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change, there\\'s\\n  no reason you can\\'t change it yourself.  The following nine-step\\n  program should be performed about every three months. \\n\\n\\n TRASH UNNEEDED FILES  (4.1)\\n\\n      Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more\\n  smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a\\n  little time cleaning up your hard disk.  If you\\'re at all like me,\\n  you\\'ll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for\\n  applications you no longer have, archives of software you\\'ve\\n  dearchived, shareware you tried out and didn\\'t like, announcements\\n  for events that have come and gone and many other files you no\\n  longer need.  If you\\'re running System 7 you may also have several\\n  more megabytes in your trash can alone.  Throw them away and empty \\n  the trash.\\n\\n\\n RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS  (4.2)\\n\\n      Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain. \\n  Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension \\n  in your collection.  If you don\\'t use the functionality of an\\n  extension at least every fifth time you boot up, you\\'re probably\\n  better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes\\n  up memory, destabilizes your system, and slows down every startup. \\n  For instance if you only read PC disks once a month, there\\'s no\\n  need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time.  Cutting back on your\\n  extension habit can really help avoid crashes. \\n\\n\\n REBUILD THE DESKTOP  (4.3)\\n\\n      The Desktop file/database holds all the information necessary\\n  to associate each file with the application that created it.  It\\n  lets the system know what application should be launched when you\\n  open a given file and what icons it should display where. \\n  Depending on its size each application has one or more\\n  representatives in the desktop file.  As applications and files\\n  move on and off your hard disk, the Desktop file can be become\\n  bloated and corrupt.  Think of it as a Congress for your Mac. \\n  Every so often it\\'s necessary to throw the bums out and start with\\n  a clean slate.  Fortunately it\\'s easier to rebuild the desktop than\\n  to defeat an incumbent. \\n  \\n         One warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments\\n  you\\'ve stored in the Get Info boxes.  Under System 7 Maurice\\n  Volaski\\'s freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments\\n  across a rebuild.  CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only \\n  if Apple\\'s Desktop Manager extension is also installed. \\n  \\n         To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and, as your\\n  extensions finish loading, depress the Command and Option keys. \\n  You\\'ll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild\\n  the desktop and warning you that \"This could take a few minutes.\" \\n  Click OK. It will take more than a few minutes. The more files you\\n  have the longer it will take.  If you\\'re running System 6 you may\\n  want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop.\\n   \\n          If you\\'re experiencing definite problems and not just doing\\n  preventive maintenance, you may want to use Fifth Generation\\'s\\n  freeware init Desktop Reset.  Desktop Reset completely deletes the\\n  Desktop file before rebuilding it, thus eliminating possibly\\n  corrupt data structures.    \\n\\n\\n ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK  (4.4)\\n\\n      All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950\\n  contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain\\n  settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk\\n  such as which disk to boot from.  Unfortunately this \"parameter\\n  RAM\" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes.  To reset\\n  it under System 7 hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys\\n  while restarting your Mac.  Under System 6 hold down the Command,\\n  Option, and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the\\n  Apple menu. Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter\\n  RAM.  Since you\\'ve erased almost all the settings in the General\\n  Control Panel, you should now reset them to whatever you want.\\n   \\n         The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the \\n  date and time; but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is\\n  notoriously inaccurate you\\'ll probably want to take this\\n  opportunity to reset it anyway.\\n\\n\\n RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP  (4.5) \\n\\n      Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most\\n  people still have at least half a row of icons march across the\\n  bottom of their screen every time they restart.  All these\\n  extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of\\n  memory called the System Heap.  If the System Heap isn\\'t big enough\\n  to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of\\n  it, they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap,\\n  knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and\\n  trying to climb back on after they get knocked off.  All this\\n  fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance\\n  and almost inevitably crashes the Mac.\\n  \\n         If you\\'re using System 7, your Macintosh will automatically\\n  resize the system heap as necessary; but if you\\'re running System 6\\n  it\\'s important to set your system heap size large enough to manage\\n  all your extensions and applications.  By default this size is set\\n  to 128K, way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all. \\n  The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot\\n  blocks of every system disk.  Bill Steinberg\\'s freeware utility\\n  BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks\\n  how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much\\n  needs to be allocated.  If you\\'re running System 6, get BootMan,\\n  use it, and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes.\\n\\n\\n REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE  (4.6)\\n\\n      System files can become corrupt and fragmented, especially if\\n  you\\'ve stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them. \\n  Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file\\n  corruption.  I recommend doing a clean reinstall.  Here\\'s how:\\n\\n    1.  Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks.  \\n    2.  Copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out \\n        of your System file into a temporary suitcase.\\n    3.  Trash the System file on your hard disk.  Also trash the \\n        Finder, MultiFinder, DA Handler, and all other standard Apple \\n        extensions like Control Panel and Chooser.  These will all be \\n        replaced in the new installation.  If you\\'re running or \\n        installing System 7, move everything in the Extensions, \\n        Control Panels, and Preferences folders into the top level \\n        of the System Folder.\\n    4.  Rename the System Folder.  Any name other than System Folder \\n        is  fine.\\n    5.  Double-click the installer script on your System disk.  Then \\n        choose Customize...  Select the appropriate software for your \\n        model Mac and printer.  You could do an Easy Install instead, \\n        but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don\\'t \\n        need that waste your memory and disk space.\\n    6.  Once installation is finished, move everything from the \\n        temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System \\n        folder.  If you\\'re asked if you want to replace anything, you \\n        forgot to take something out in step 3.  You\\'ll need to replace \\n        things individually until you find the duplicate piece. \\n    7.  Reinstall any fonts or DA\\'s you removed in step 2.\\n    8.  Reboot.  You should now have a clean, defragmented System file \\n        that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable \\n        system overall.\\n\\n\\n     DISK UTILITIES  (4.7)\\n\\n      Much like system files hard disks have data structures that\\n  occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even\\n  causing data loss.  Apple includes Disk First Aid, a simple utility\\n  for detecting and repairing hard disk problems, with its System\\n  disks. It\\'s also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in\\n  the  directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc.  Even if you have an earlier \\n  version, you should get the latest version (7.1) from ftp.apple.com\\n  and run it on all your hard disks.\\n     \\n         Several companies have released payware disk utilities that\\n  detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid\\n  though, interestingly, none of them detect and repair everything\\n  that Disk First Aid does.  The three most effective for general\\n  work are Central Point\\'s MacTools Deluxe 2.0, Fifth Generation\\'s\\n  Public Utilites, and Symantec\\'s Norton Utilities for the Macintosh\\n  2.0.  A department or work group should have all of these as well\\n  as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do. \\n  For individuals MacTools ($48 street) is about half the price of\\n  Norton ($94 street) or Public Utilities ($98 street) so, features\\n  and ease of use being roughly equal, I recommend MacTools.\\n   \\n         All of these products occasionally encounter problems they\\n  can\\'t fix.  When that happens it\\'s time to backup (4.7) and\\n  reformat (4.9).\\n\\n\\n     BACKING UP  (4.8)\\n\\n      This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be\\n  done a LOT more often than every three months.  The simplest back\\n  up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies\\n  or other removable media.  If you keep your data files separate\\n  from your application and support files then it\\'s easy to only back\\n  up those folders which change frequently.  Nonetheless every three\\n  months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk. \\n  \\n         A number of programs are available to make backing up\\n  easier.  Apple included a very basic full backup application with\\n  System 6.  With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup\\n  utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder\\n  onto floppies.  The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the\\n  Mac and MacTools Deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup\\n  utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups.\\n  \\n         Finally if you\\'re lucky enough to have a Tape Drive, network\\n  server, or removable media device to use for backups, you should\\n  check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux ($49 street,\\n  doesn\\'t support tape drives) and Diskfit Pro ($74 street).  There\\n  are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD\\n  Backup from System 6.  \\n\\n\\n DISK DEFRAGMENTATION  (4.9)\\n\\n      As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free\\n  space in the same place to write large files.  Therefore the\\n  operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be\\n  stored in different places on your hard disk.  As files become more\\n  and more fragmented performance can degrade.  There are several\\n  ways to defragment a hard disk.\\n  \\n         The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your\\n  files, erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while\\n  you\\'re at it.  See question 4.10.), and restore all the files.\\n   \\n         A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for\\n  the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place, i.e.\\n  without erasing it.  Although the ads for all these products brag\\n  about their safety, once you\\'ve bought the software and opened the\\n  shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before\\n  defragmenting it in case something does go wrong.  There are NO\\n  freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don\\'t annoy the\\n  net by asking for one. \\n\\n\\n REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK  (4.10)\\n\\n      Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use, so a\\n  hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data.  You don\\'t\\n  need to reformat every three months; but when your system is\\n  crashing no matter what you try, reformatting is the ultimate means\\n  of wiping the slate clean.  Reformatting your hard disk may even\\n  gain you a few extra megabytes of space.  Not all hard disks are\\n  created equal.  Some can hold more data than others.  To facilitate\\n  mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks (* 81.3\\n  megabytes is the average formatted capacity.  Your mileage may\\n  vary.)  Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator\\n  of drive capacity.  When you reformat there\\'s no reason at all not\\n  to reclaim whatever unused space Apple\\'s left on your disk.\\n     \\n         Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to\\n  initialize them. Most hard disks come with formatting software. \\n  Apple\\'s disks and System software ship with HD SC setup, a minimal\\n  disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY. \\n  Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with\\n  their hard drives.  Normally this will be all you need to reformat\\n  your hard disk.\\n  \\n         A number of general-purpose formatters are also available\\n  which go beyond the bundled software to include features like\\n  encryption, password protection, multiple partitioning, faster disk\\n  access, System 7 compatibility, and even compression.  Two of the\\n  best are the payware Drive7 and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition\\n  ($49 street for either).  While there are one or two freeware\\n  formatters available, none are likely to be superior to the ones\\n  bundled with your hard disk. \\n  \\n         PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and\\n  processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter\\n  what software they use.  Otherwise disk corruption, crashes, and\\n  data losses are a very good possibility.\\n  \\n',\n",
